Introduction
============

Ice-E is a compact subset of Ice designed for embedded environments
while retaining many of the features that have made Ice such a
compelling alternative for distributed applications.


Comparing Ice-E and Ice
=======================

In order to reduce the size of the Ice-E run time, several Ice
features have been removed, and others are optional. The differences
are discussed in the sections below.


Concurrency Models
------------------

Ice-E supports only the thread pool concurrenny model like Ice.
However, unlike Ice, Ice-E does not support the configuring of
per-adapter thread pools.


Transports
----------

Ice-E includes support for the TCP transport; UDP and SSL are not
supported. The built-in TCP transport can be replaced with one of your
own.


Servant Locators
----------------

Ice-E does not support servant locators. However, Ice-E does support
default servants. A default servant is a regular servant that you
implement and register with an object adapter. For each incoming
request, the object adapter first attempts to locate a servant in its
Active Servant Map (ASM). If no servant is found, the object adapter
dispatches the request to a default servant. With this design, a
default servant is the object adapter's servant of last resort if no
match was found in the ASM.

The default servant API consists of the following operations in the
object adapter interface.

module Ice {
    interface ObjectAdapter {
        // ...

        void addDefaultServant(Object servant, string category);

        Object removeDefaultServant(string category);

        Object findDefaultServant(string category);

        // ...
    };
};

As you can see, the object adapter allows you to add, remove and find
default servants. Note that, when you register a default servant, you
must provide an argument for the category parameter. The value of the
category parameter controls which object identities the default servant
is responsible for: only object identities with a matching category
member trigger a dispatch to this default servant. An incoming request
for which no explicit entry exists in the ASM and with a category for
which no default servant is registered returns an ObjectNotExistException
to the client.

addDefaultServant has the following semantics:

 * You can register exactly one default servant for a specific category.
   Attempts to call addDefaultServant for the same category more than
   once raise an AlreadyRegisteredException.

 * You can register different default servants for different categories,
   or you can register the same single default servant multiple times
   (each time for a different category). In the former case, the category
   is implicit in the default servant instance that is called by the Ice-E
   run time; in the latter case, the servant can find out which category
   the incoming request is for by examining the object identity member of
   the Current object that is passed to the dispatched operation.

 * It is legal to register a default servant for the empty category. Such
   a servant is used if a request comes in for which no entry exists in
   the ASM, and whose category does not match the category of any other
   registered default servant.

The removeDefaultServant operation allows you to remove the default servant
for a specific category. It returns the servant that was removed. If no
default servant is registered for the specified category, removeDefaultServant
throws a NotRegisteredException.

The findDefaultServant operation allows you to retrieve the default servant
for a specific category (including the empty category). If no default servant
is registered for the specified category, findDefaultServant returns null.


Collocation Optimization
------------------------

Support for collocation optimization has been removed. Note that
Ice-E applications are still able to make invocations on collocated
servants, but those invocations are not optimized and therefore will
be marshaled and sent over the built-in transport.


Other Removed Features
----------------------

Ice-E has also eliminated the following features:

* Asynchronous dispatch (AMD)
* Streaming APIs
* Active connection management
* Protocol compression
* Ice::Application and Ice::Service classes
* Local interfaces


Optional Features
-----------------

A number of Ice-E features are optional and can be omitted during
compilation to further reduce the size of the Ice-E run time. See the
"Configuration" section below for more information.


Compatibility
-------------

Ice-E and Ice share the same C++ mapping and remain source-code
compatible, given the limitations described above. Furthermore,
since the two products also share the same protocol, a distributed
system can use any combination of Ice and Ice-E applications.


Customization
-------------

If the current features do not meet your requirements, ZeroC can
customize Ice-E for commercial users. Please contact us at
info@zeroc.com for more information.


Run-time Libraries
==================

In order to minimize the size of Ice-E applications, two versions of
the run time library are provided:

* The "client" library is suitable for applications requiring only
  client-side functionality.

* The "server" library supports client- and server-side functionality.

A simple rule of thumb is to use the server library if your program
creates an object adapter, otherwise you can use the client library.

Users of the client library must define the preprocessor macro
ICEE_PURE_CLIENT when compiling an application and link with the
appropriate run time library.


Configuration
=============

You may build the Ice-E run-time libraries with certain components
disabled in order to further reduce the size of your applications. The
default configuration enables all of the optional components, but you
can selectively disable them by editing the file config/Make.rules
(Linux) or config\Make.rules.mak (Windows) and modifying their
corresponding settings. The optional components are described below.
For more information on these features, please refer to the Ice
manual.

Before building Ice-E for the first time, or after any change to the
configuration settings in Make.rules or Make.rules.mak, you must
make the "configure" target as shown below:

On Linux:

  $ make configure

On Windows:

  > nmake /f Makefile.mak configure

The purpose of the "configure" target is to generate the header file
include/Ice/Features.h with preprocessor macros that correspond to
your settings in Make.rules or Make.rules.mak.


Router Support
--------------

If HAS_ROUTER is enabled, the Ice-E libraries will include support for
the Ice router facility. This component is necessary in order to use
Ice-E with the Glacier2 router.

Applications that use routers often also receive callbacks from remote
servers. These applications must use the server library, because the
client library does not provide support for callbacks.


Locator Support
---------------

If HAS_LOCATOR is enabled, the Ice-E libraries will include support
for the Ice locator facility. This component is necessary in order to
use indirect proxies in Ice-E.


Batch Messages Support
----------------------

If HAS_BATCH is enabled, the Ice-E client library will include support
for sending batch messages. This feature cannot be disabled in the
server library.


Wstring and String Converter Support
------------------------------------

If HAS_WSTRING is enabled, the Ice-E libraries will include support
for using wide strings as well as configuring custom string
converters.


Opaque Endpoint Support
-----------------------

The HAS_OPAQUE_ENDPOINTS setting determines whether the Ice run time
preserves proxy endpoints whose types are not recognized. This feature
is unnecessary in an environment in which all clients and servers use
Ice-E, since TCP is the only supported transport. When Ice-E programs
communicate with Ice programs, however, it is possible for an Ice-E
program to receive a proxy that contains unsupported endpoints, such
as SSL or UDP. Ice-E discards these endpoints when this feature is
disabled, but discarding the endpoints prevents an Ice-E program from
forwarding the proxy with its original endpoints intact. Enabling
opaque endpoints causes Ice-E to retain unknown endpoints in the proxy
and include them if the proxy is later marshaled.


Asychronous Method Invocation Support
-------------------------------------

If HAS_AMI is enabled, the Ice-E client mapping and library will
include support for issuing remote invocations asynchronously with
guaranteed non-blocking semantics.
