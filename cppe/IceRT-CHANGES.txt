IceE-rt Changes
--------------------------

Thead
-----

Added a new start operation that permit pass a priority that should
be used to start the thread, the priority value is representend as a
int and is system depended, for Posix system the priority should be a 
valid priority for the underliying SCHED_RR scheduller. Other supported
system has not the scheduller concept.

Threads that are started without a priority use the system default priority
as was the previous behaviour.

Note that in Posix root privileges are required for use SCHED_RR.

ThreadControl Api addtions.
---------------------------

added Method for getPriority setPriority that permit get/set the 
priority of runing thread, get/set the priority of not runing thread 
should not be valid.

Posix mutex implementation aditions.
------------------------------------

MutexProtocol enumerator
---------------------------------
This enumerator that could be one of PrioNone or PrioInherit is used to
set the underlying protocol of a posix mutex.


RecMutex Mutex updates.
-----------------------
Mutex and RecMutex has a new ctor that permit pass a MutexProtocol parameter
that would be used to initialize the underliying posix mutex on non posix this
parameter does nothing.

Default construted Mutex and RecMutex use the MutexProtocol returned by getDefaultMutexProtocol

this function is defined in MutexProtocol.h with ICE_API so it could be override in the
application main.

Timer
----------------------

Timer has now a new construtor that permit set the priority used by the thread owned 
by this timer


New Properties
----------------------

Ice.ThreadPriority

    This property set the priority of Ice internal threads to a os native thread
    priority.

    In Posix system the priority should be a valid priority for SCHED_RR
    scheduller.

    In WindowsCe is any of the valid system priorities and you should use the number
    not equivalent constants when set the property.

    This priority is also used for Threads create in any thread pool, if not specific
    priority is set for a thread pool.


Ice.ThreadPool.Server.ThreadPriority

    This property set the priority of the threads create in this ThreadPool.

Ice.ThreadPool.Server.ThreadPriority

    This property set the priority of the threads create in this ThreadPool.

Tests
---------------------

Real time tests need to run as super user on posix systems.

There are 2 different test for real time features

test/IceE/priority
test/IceE/threadPoolPriority


Removed
--------------

StaticMutex

  This class is remove as there is no way for resolve priority inversion issues with the
underliying static mutex implementation of posix.
