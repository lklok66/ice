Silverlight Runtime
-------------------

- Silverlight 1.1 Alpha

  http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/resources/LicenseWinDev.aspx


Ice for .NET
------------

To use the Ice for Silverlight bridge, you must also install Ice for
.NET version 3.3 (Ice.dll).

The Ice distribution can be downloaded here:

  http://www.zeroc.com/download.html

Once downloaded or compiled, the DLL must be installed in the GAC:

  gacutil -i Ice.dll


Slice-to-Silverlight translator
-------------------------------

You will need the Slice-to-Silverlight translator (slice2sl). You can
download a binary distribution from the ZeroC web site, or you can
build the Slice-to-Silverlight translator yourself.

Binary and source distributions are available at

  http://www.zeroc.com/labs/download.html


Third-party libraries
---------------------

The Ice for Silverlight compiler (slice2sl) has a dependency on the
following third-party library:

- mcpp 2.7 with patch

If you want to build the slice2sl translator yourself, you do not need
to build mcpp yourself, as ZeroC supplies a Windows installer for the
VC9 compiler that contains release and debug libraries for all of the
third-party dependencies.

If you intend to build the third-party dependencies from source, we
recommend downloading the Ice third-party source archive from

  http://www.zeroc.com/download.html

This archive contains the source distributions for each of the
third-party dependencies, as well as required source patches and
configuration instructions.

For more information about this dependency, please refer to the link
below:

  http://mcpp.sourceforge.net


======================================================================
Compilation
======================================================================

Unpack the archive. The sources are contained in the IceSL-@ver@
subdirectory.


Building the slice2sl translator
--------------------------------

If you have not already downloaded the slice2sl binary distribution as
mentioned above, follow these steps to build the translator yourself:

1) In a Visual Studio 2008 command prompt, change to the cpp subdirectory
   of the Ice for Silverlight source distribution.

2) Open config\Make.rules.mak and review the comments that describe
   the settings you can modify.

3) Run nmake:

   > nmake /f Makefile.mak


Building the core DLL
---------------------

Follow these steps to build the Ice for Silverlight source:

1) Change to the sl subdirectory of the Ice for Silverlight source
   distribution.

2) Open config\Make.rules.cs.mak and review the comments that describe
   the settings you can modify. For example, you may wish to enable
   optimization.

3) If you do not build the translator yourself, the directory containing
   the translator executables must be added to your PATH. For example, if
   the translator distribution is installed in C:\IceSL-@ver@, you must
   add C:\IceSL-@ver@\bin to your PATH.

4) Run nmake:

   > nmake /f Makefile.mak


Building the tests and demos
----------------------------

Each test and demo is contained in its own solution. To build the
tests and demos do the following:

1) The directory containing the translator executables must be added
   to your PATH. For example, if the translator distribution is
   installed in C:\IceSL-@ver@, you must add C:\IceSL-@ver@\bin to
   your PATH.

2) Start the Visual Studio 2008 IDE and open the desired
   solution file (demo\Ice\hello\hello.sln for example).

3) Select Build->Build Solution to build both projects in the
   solution.

4) Repeat for each test or demo.


======================================================================
Running the tests and demos
======================================================================

Since Ice for Silverlight provides client-side functionality only, you
must use Ice servers from another Ice language mapping in order to run
the tests and demos. Any of the Ice 3.3 mappings that provide server-
side functionality (C++, Java, C#, Python) can be used.

Note that the Windows binary installer for Ice only contains the Ice
demos, but not the Ice tests. Therefore, to run the tests, you will
need to download and compile one of the source distributions. They can
be downloaded here:

  http://www.zeroc.com/download.html

To run a test or demo do the following:

1) Start the corresponding server from the Ice 3.3 distribution that
   you compiled. See the instructions in the Ice 3.3 distribution for
   information on how to start the server.

2) Start the Visual Studio 2008 IDE and open the selected test or demo
   solution file.

3) Right-click on the WebApplication project and select Properties.
   Select the Web tab, change the Start Action to be a Specific Page
   and choose TestPage.html.

4) Right-click on the WebApplication project and select
   Debug->Start new instance. This causes a browser window to be
   spawned.

5) Click on the button in the browser to run the test or demo.


======================================================================
Installation
======================================================================

Ice for Silverlight does not support automatic installation.
