======================================================================
Requirements
======================================================================


Windows Version
---------------

Ice for Silverlight has been extensively tested on:

- Windows XP x86 with Internet Explorer 6.0 and FireFox 3.0


Compiler
--------

Ice for Silverlight requires:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2008

  http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx

- Microsoft Silverlight Tools Beta 2 for Visual Studio 2008

  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=50A9EC01-267B-4521-B7D7-C0DBA8866434&displaylang=en


Silverlight Runtime
-------------------

- Silverlight 2.0 Beta 2

  Downloaded as part of the Visual Studio Tools above.


Ice for .NET
------------

To use the Ice for Silverlight bridge, you must also install Ice for
.NET version 3.3 (Ice.dll).

The Ice distribution can be downloaded here:

  http://www.zeroc.com/download.html

Once downloaded or compiled, the DLL must be installed in the GAC:

  gacutil -i Ice.dll


Slice-to-Silverlight translator
-------------------------------

You will need the Slice-to-Silverlight translator (slice2sl). You can
download a binary distribution from the ZeroC web site, or you can
build the Slice-to-Silverlight translator yourself using this source
distribution.

Binary distributions are available at

  http://www.zeroc.com/labs/download.html


Third-party libraries
---------------------

The Ice for Silverlight compiler (slice2sl) has a dependency on the
following third-party library:

- mcpp 2.7 with patch

If you want to build the slice2sl translator yourself, you do not need
to build mcpp yourself, as ZeroC supplies a Third-Party Windows installer
for the VC9 compiler that contains release and debug libraries for all
of the third-party dependencies.

If you intend to build the third-party dependencies from source, we
recommend downloading the Ice third-party source archive from

  http://www.zeroc.com/download.html

This archive contains the source distributions for each of the
third-party dependencies, as well as required source patches and
configuration instructions.

For more information about this dependency, please refer to the link
below:

  http://mcpp.sourceforge.net


======================================================================
Compilation
======================================================================

Unpack the archive. The sources are contained in the IceSL-@ver@
subdirectory.


Building the slice2sl translator
--------------------------------

If you have not already downloaded the binary distribution as mentioned
above, follow these steps to build the translator yourself:

1) In a Visual Studio 2008 command prompt, change to the cpp subdirectory
   of the Ice for Silverlight source distribution.

2) Open config\Make.rules.mak and review the comments that describe
   the settings you can modify.

3) Run nmake:

   > nmake /f Makefile.mak


Building the core DLL
---------------------

Follow these steps to build the Ice for Silverlight source:

1) Change to the sl subdirectory of the Ice for Silverlight source
   distribution.

2) Open config\Make.rules.cs.mak and review the comments that describe
   the settings you can modify. For example, you may wish to enable
   optimization.

3) If you do not build the translator yourself, the directory containing
   the translator executables must be added to your PATH. For example, if
   the translator distribution is installed in C:\IceSL-@ver@, you must
   add C:\IceSL-@ver@\bin to your PATH.

4) Run nmake:

   > nmake /f Makefile.mak


Building the tests and demos
----------------------------

Each test and demo is contained in its own solution. To build the
tests and demos do the following:

1) The directory containing the translator executables must be added
   to your PATH. For example, if the translator distribution is
   installed in C:\IceSL-@ver@, you must add C:\IceSL-@ver@\bin to
   your PATH.

2) Start the Visual Studio 2008 IDE and open the desired
   solution file (demo\Ice\hello\hello.sln for example).

3) Select Build->Build Solution to build both projects in the
   solution.

4) Repeat for each test or demo.


======================================================================
Running the tests and demos
======================================================================

Since Ice for Silverlight provides client-side functionality only, you
must use Ice servers from another Ice language mapping in order to run
the tests and demos. Any of the Ice 3.3 mappings that provide server-
side functionality (C++, Java, .NET, Python) can be used, although the
dictMapping and seqMapping tests are only found in .NET.

Note that the Windows binary installer for Ice only contains the Ice
demos, but not the Ice tests. Therefore, to run the tests, you will
need to download and compile one of the source distributions. They can
be downloaded here:

  http://www.zeroc.com/download.html

To run a test or demo do the following:

1) Start the corresponding server from the Ice 3.3 distribution that
   you compiled. See the instructions in the Ice 3.3 distribution for
   information on how to start the server.

2) Start the Visual Studio 2008 IDE and open the selected test or demo
   solution file.

3) Right-click on TestPage.html and choose "Set As Start Page".

4) Right-click on the Web project and select Debug->Start new instance.
   This causes a browser window to be spawned.

5) Click on the button in the browser to run the test or demo.


======================================================================
Installation
======================================================================

Ice for Silverlight does not support automatic installation.


======================================================================
Creating a new project.
======================================================================

The following steps explain how to create a new project in Visual
Studio 2008 that uses Ice for Silverlight.

1) In the IDE select "File->New->Project".

2) In the "New Project" dialog select "Silverlight Application" under
   "Other Languages->Visual C#->Silverlight" and click OK.

3) In the "Add Silverlight Application" choose "Add a new Web to the 
   solution for hosting the control" and "Web Application Project"
   as the project type and click OK. This will create two projects, the
   Silverlight project plus a Web project.

4) Right click on the <project name>TestPage.html and choose "Set As
   Start Page"

5) Add the Ice HTTP bridge to the Web project by right clicking on the
   project, choosing "Add->Existing Item" and then browsing to the 
   location of the IceBridge.ashx file in the Ice for Silverlight
   distribution.

6) Edit Web.config, find the compilation section, and add a reference
   for the Ice for .NET 3.3 assembly

   <compilation debug="true">
     <assemblies>
        <add assembly="System.Core, Version=3.5.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=B77A5C561934E089"/>
        ...
        <add assembly="Ice, Version=3.3.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cdd571ade22f2f16, processorArchitecture=MSIL"/>
      </assemblies>
    </compilation>

7) Add a "Global Application Class" to the Web project by right clicking on
   the Web project and selecting "Add->New Item" and choosing "Global
   Application Class" in the "Add New Item" dialog.

8) Edit the Global.ashx.cs file and add code to initialize and destroy the
   Ice communicator in the Application_Start and Application_End functions.

   protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
   {
       Application["com"] = Ice.Util.initialize();
   }

   protected void Application_End(object sender, EventArgs e)
   {
       Ice.Communicator com = (Ice.Communicator) Application["com"];
       try
       {
           com.destroy();
       }
       catch (Exception)
       {
       }
   }

9) Add a reference to the Ice for .NET 3.3 assembly to the Web projects by
   right clicking on References, selecting "Add Reference" and in the "Browse"
   tab locate Ice.dll and select it.

10) Add slice compilation to the regular project by manually editing the 
    project file and adding something similar to the following at the end of
    the file, changing the name of the slice file appropriately.

      ...
      <Target Name="CompileSlice" Inputs="Test.ice" Outputs="generated\Test.cs">
        <Exec Command="slice2sl.exe --output-dir generated Test.ice"/>
      </Target>
      <Target Name="AfterClean">
        <Delete Files="generated\Test.cs"/>
      </Target>
      <PropertyGroup>
        <CompileDependsOn>
          CompileSlice;$(CompileDependsOn)
        </CompileDependsOn>
      </PropertyGroup>
    </Project>

    Create a directory in the project directory named generated and then build
    the project to run the slice2sl task. Now add the generated C# file to the
    project by right-clicking on the project and choosing "Add->Existing Item".

Your project is now setup and you are ready to start developing your
application using Ice for Silverlight. Please see the tests and demo for
examples.
