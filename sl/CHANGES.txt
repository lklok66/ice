Changes since version 0.1.0
---------------------------

- Ice for Silverlight now supports Silverlight 2.0 Beta 1 and no 
  longer supports Silverlight 1.1 alpha.

- It is no longer possible to make synchronous calls from the UI
  thread. However, it is now possible to make both synchronous and
  asynchronous calls from non-UI threads.

- All of the communicator initialize functions now require a class of 
  type System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher to be passed as first
  paramater.

- Due to changes in classes supported by Silverlight, it is no longer
  possible to use LinkedList<T>, Stack<T>, and Queue<T> as alternate
  sequence mappings in slice.
