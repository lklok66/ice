Changes since version 0.1.0
---------------------------

- Ice for Silverlight now supports Silverlight 2.0 Beta 2 and no 
  longer supports Silverlight 1.1 alpha.

- It is no longer possible to make synchronous calls from the UI
  thread. However, it is now possible to make both synchronous and
  asynchronous calls from non-UI threads.

- A new property, Ice.FactoryAssemblies, has been added that allows
  you to specify assemblies that contain types required for user
  exceptions and objects-by-value.

- Due to changes in classes supported by Silverlight, it is no longer
  possible to use LinkedList<T>, Stack<T>, and Queue<T> as alternate
  sequence mappings in your Slice definitions.
