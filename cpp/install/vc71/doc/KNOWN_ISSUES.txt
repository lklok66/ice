Binary compatibility on Mono

------------------------------



Mono currently has issues with forwarding requests to load a particular

version of the runtime to a different version. Until this is resolved

in Mono, you cannot run applications compiled with 2.1.0 against the

2.1.1 runtime.





Mono on Mac OS X

----------------


The Ice for C# slicing/objects test currently fails with Mono on Mac OS X.

We believe that this is caused by a bug in the Mono runtime and we are

working with the Mono developers to resolve this.



Ice for Visual Basic uses the same runtime as Ice for C# and is therefore

affected by this problem as well.
