The Internet Communications Engine
----------------------------------

Ice is a modern alternative to object middleware such as CORBA or
COM/DCOM/COM+. It is easy to learn, yet provides a powerful network
infrastructure for demanding technical applications. It features an
object-oriented specification language, easy to use C++, Java, Python,
PHP, C#, and Visual Basic mappings, a highly efficient protocol,
asynchronous method invocation and dispatch, dynamic transport
plug-ins, TCP/IP and UDP/IP support, SSL-based security, a firewall
solution, and much more.

Ice is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL) (see LICENSE file). Commercial licenses are available for
customers who wish to use Ice in proprietary products. Please contact
sales@zeroc.com for more information on licensing Ice.

This file describes how to setup Visual Studio for Ice, and provides
instructions for building and running the sample programs.

See doc/README.html for information on the documentation included with
this distribution.


Visual Studio Requirements
--------------------------

This release requires Visual Studio .NET 2003 build 3088 or later. For
C# or VB the release requires .NET 1.1, build 4322 or later.


Setting up Visual Studio .NET for C++
-------------------------------------

Before you can use Ice in your C++ applications, you first need to
configure Visual Studio with the locations of the Ice header files,
libraries, and executables.

- In the IDE, choose Tools->Options->Projects->VC++ Directories

- Select "Include files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\include

- Select "Library files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\lib

- Select "Executable files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\bin


Setting up Visual Studio .NET for C#
------------------------------------

To maintain source code compatibility between .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0,
the Slice compiler generates code that uses the conditional symbol
ICE_DOTNET_1X for sequences having the "clr:collection" metadata.
If you use .NET 1.1 and your Slice definitions use this metadata for
sequences, you must define ICE_DOTNET_1X during compilation.

In Visual Studio, open your project's properties page and choose
Configuration Properties. Add ICE_DOTNET_1X to Conditional
Compilation Constants, using a semicolon to separate it from any
existing values.


Using the IceGrid Administrative Console
----------------------------------------

A Java-based graphical tool for administering IceGrid applications
is included in this distribution. The Java archive (JAR) file is
installed as

<Ice installation root directory>\bin\IceGridGUI.jar

With a suitable Java installation, you can execute the application
directly by double-clicking on its icon, or you can start it from
a command prompt:

> java -jar IceGridGUI.jar


Building and running the C++ demos
----------------------------------

The C++ demos are in the demo directory.

To build a C++ demo, start Visual Studio .NET and open the solution
demo\demo.sln. Right click on the desired demo in the Solution
Explorer window and select "Build".

To run these demos, you need to add the Ice bin directory to your
PATH, as shown below:

set ICE_HOME=<Ice installation root directory>
set PATH=%ICE_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

Next, open a Command Prompt, change to the desired demo subdirectory,
and type 'server' to start the server. In a separate Command Prompt
window, type 'client' to start the client.

Some demo directories contain README files if additional requirements
are necessary.


Building and running the C# demos
---------------------------------

The C# demos are in the democs directory.

To build a C# demo, start Visual Studio .NET and open the solution
democs\demo.sln. Right click on the desired demo in the Solution
Explorer window and select "Build".

To run a demo, open a Command Prompt, change to the desired demo
directory, and type 'server.exe' to start the server. In a separate
Command Prompt window, type 'client.exe' to run the client.

Some demo directories contain README files if additional requirements
are necessary.


Building and running the Visual Basic demos
-------------------------------------------

The Visual Basic demos are in the demovb directory.

To build a Visual Basic demo, start Visual Studio .NET and open the
solution demovb\demo.sln. Right click on the desired demo in the
Solution Explorer window and select "Build".

To run a demo, open a Command Prompt, change to the desired demo
directory, and type 'server.exe' to start the server. In a separate
Command Prompt window, type 'client.exe' to run the client.

Some demo directories contain README files if additional requirements
are necessary.


Binary compatibility
--------------------

Patch releases of Ice are binary compatible. For example, version
<x>.<y>.1 is compatible with <x>.<y>.0, so you can run applications
compiled with <x>.<y>.0 with <x>.<y>.1 (or later) assemblies without
having to recompile.

With the binary installers, simply uninstall the previous version of
Ice and install the new one. Already deployed applications that were
compiled against the <x>.<y>.<z> run time will automatically use the
<x>.<y>.<z or z+n> assemblies.

Note: Under Mono, binary compatibility currently does not work due to
      issues with Mono. Until this problem in Mono is fixed, you cannot
      run applications compiled with previous minor versions of Ice
      against a newer version of the Ice assemblies. For example, an
      application compiled with version <x>.<y>.0 of Ice cannot run with
      the <x>.<y>.1 Ice assemblies.
