Instructions on building UNIX binary distributions
==================================================

Creating the UNIX installers includes a few manual steps but is
straightforward. The key stages are:
 * Building Ice
    - obtaining and possibly building required third party libraries
      This is essentially the same thing as described in our INSTALL.x
      files.  

    - establishing the build environment
      This is the same as just building Ice.

    - obtaining source distributions
      You can either obtain them by running makedist.py in each CVS
      source tree, copying them from another location, or allowing
      makebindist.py to collect them. It is recommended that you build
      the source distributions on Linux and copy the source distros to
      the UNIX build machine.

    - run makebindist.py
      The makebindist.py script does the following:
       * unpacks the source distributions into working directories
       * massages the build system as appropriate
       * builds the Ice components
       * installs the Ice components into a staging install directory
       * copies third party libraries that need to accompany the
         distribution
       * creates gzipped tarballs for distribution

     On Linux, makebindist.py also:
       * creates the demo sources tarball
       * creates RPMs from the staged install directory
       * creates an SRPM

On Linux, you more or less just need to run makebindist.py with the
appropriate flags and walk away. On other UNIX platforms, you will need
to do some initial setup by updating third party libraries and tools,
but after that is done the only extra step is downloading the source
distributions before running makebindist.py.
