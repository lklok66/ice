The Internet Communications Engine
----------------------------------

Ice is a modern alternative to object middleware such as CORBA or
COM/DCOM/COM+. It is easy to learn, yet provides a powerful network
infrastructure for demanding technical applications. It features an
object-oriented specification language, easy to use C++, C#, Java,
Python, Ruby, PHP, and Visual Basic mappings, a highly efficient
protocol, asynchronous method invocation and dispatch, dynamic
transport plug-ins, TCP/IP and UDP/IP support, SSL-based security, a
firewall solution, and much more.

Ice is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL) (see LICENSE file). Commercial licenses are available for
customers who wish to use Ice in proprietary products. Please contact
sales@zeroc.com for more information on licensing Ice.


About this distribution
-----------------------

This binary distribution provides all Ice run time services and 
development tools to build Ice applications in C++ using Visual
Studio 2005 for the x64 architecture.

If you want to develop Ice applications in another programming
language, or with another C++ compiler, please download the 
appropriate Ice binary distribution from the ZeroC web site at

  http://www.zeroc.com/download.html

This file describes how to setup Visual Studio for Ice and provides 
instructions for building and running the sample programs.


Supported Windows versions
--------------------------

This distribution is only supported on Windows Server 2003 x64 
Standard.


Setting up Visual Studio 2005 to build Ice applications in C++
--------------------------------------------------------------

Before you can use Ice in your C++ applications, you first need to
configure Visual Studio with the locations of the Ice header files,
libraries, and executables.

- In the IDE, choose Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++ Directories

- Select "Include files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\include

- Select "Library files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\lib

- Select "Executable files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\bin


Running IceGrid and Glacier2 components as services
---------------------------------------------------

The WINDOWS_SERVICES.txt file included in this distribution contains
information on how to install and run the IceGrid registry, IceGrid
node, and Glacier2 router as Windows services.


Building and running the C++ demos
----------------------------------

The C++ demos are in the demo directory.

To build a C++ demo, start Visual Studio 2005 and open the solution
demo\demo.sln. Right click on the desired demo in the Solution
Explorer window and select "Build".

To run these demos, you need to add the Ice bin directory to your
PATH, as shown below:

set ICE_HOME=<Ice installation root directory>
set PATH=%ICE_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

Next, open a Command Prompt, change to the desired demo subdirectory,
and type 'server' to start the server. In a separate Command Prompt
window, type 'client' to start the client.

Some demo directories contain README files if additional requirements
are necessary.

The Ice demo source code archive and Windows installers for Visual
Studio .NET 2003 and Visual Studio 2005 include examples for integrating
Ice with databases other than BerkeleyDB. These demos are not supported
for Visual Studio 2005 for 64 bit platforms and are not included in
this distribution.


Binary compatibility
--------------------

Patch releases of Ice are binary compatible. For example, version <x>.<y>.1
is compatible with <x>.<y>.0, so you can run applications compiled with
<x>.<y>.0 with <x>.<y>.1 (or later) assemblies without having to recompile.

With the binary installers, simply uninstall the previous version of
Ice and install the new one. Already deployed applications that were
compiled against the <x>.<y>.<z> run time will automatically use the
<x>.<y>.<z or z+n> assemblies.
