Installer for Visual Studio .NET 2002 aka VC 7.0:
------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a Visual Studio .NET 2002 solution to create
Microsoft Windows Installers (.msi) for Ice and the third party
products Ice depends on.

These projects were created with all the source distributions
installed in C:\builds i.e.:
 - C:\builds\ice (Ice for C++)
 - C:\builds\icej (Ice for Java)
 - C:\builds\icepy (Ice for Python)
 - C:\buids\icephp (Ice for PHP)
 - C:\builds\icecs (Ice for C#) (optional)
 - C:\builds\icevb (Ice for Visual Basic) (optional)

If you use a different directory structure, you will need to adjust
some paths in the project files.

The solution has two configurations:

 - ThirdParty, to build the ThirdParty.msi installers from source
   distributions of Berkeley DB, bzip2/libbzip2, OpenSSL and
   Expat. All the source distributions must be built with both Debug
   and Release configurations, except OpenSSL and Expat (release
   only). This configuration also generates Merge Modules (.msm files)
   for these products in the MergeModules directory.

 - Ice, to build the Ice.msi installers from the various Ice source
   distributions, and merge modules for Berkeley DB, OpenSSL and
   Expat.  Ice for C++ must be built with both Debug and Release
   configurations; Ice for Java should be built with optimize set to
   on; Ice for Python and Ice for PHP should be built only with the
   Release configuration.  Ice for C# should be built debug only, with
   Visual C# 7.1.  The merge modules for the third party dependencies
   can be either created through the ThirdParty configuration (which
   requires building the corresponding source distributions) or
   downloaded from http://www.zeroc.com/download.html
