The Internet Communications Engine
----------------------------------

Ice is a modern alternative to object middleware such as CORBA or
COM/DCOM/COM+. It is easy to learn, yet provides a powerful network
infrastructure for demanding technical applications. It features an
object-oriented specification language, easy to use C++, Java, Python,
PHP, C#, and Visual Basic mappings, a highly efficient protocol,
asynchronous method invocation and dispatch, dynamic transport
plug-ins, TCP/IP and UDP/IP support, SSL-based security, a firewall
solution, and much more.

Ice is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL) (see LICENSE file). Commercial licenses are available for
customers who wish to use Ice in proprietary products. Please contact
sales@zeroc.com for more information on licensing Ice.

This file describes how to setup Visual Studio 6.0 for Ice, and
provides instructions for building and running the sample programs.

See doc/README.html for information on the documentation included with
this distribution.


C++Builder Requirements
--------------------------

This release requires C++Builder 2006 update 2.


Binary compatibility
--------------------

Patch releases of Ice are binary compatible. For example, version <x>.<y>.1
is compatible with <x>.<y>.0, so you can run applications compiled with
<x>.<y>.0 with <x>.<y>.1 (or later) assemblies without having to recompile.

With the binary installers, simply uninstall the previous version of
Ice and install the new one. Already deployed applications that were
compiled against the <x>.<y>.<z> run time will automatically use the
<x>.<y>.<z or z+n> assemblies.

Note: Under Mono, binary compatibility currently does not work due to
      issues with Mono. Until this problem in Mono is fixed, you cannot
      run applications compiled with previous minor versions of Ice
      against a newer version of the Ice assemblies. For example, an
      application compiled with version x.y.0 of Ice cannot run with
      the x.y.1 Ice assemblies.
