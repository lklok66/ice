Creating RPM packages for Ice
=============================

As well as being able to download prebuilt RPM packages, Ice now
includes a sample RPM specification file that can be used to create
your own RPMs. Using this specification file and the Ice source and
demo distributions, you can create specialized RPMs with different
compiler settings, custom component configurations or even a
reorganized installation directory structure to suit your needs. You
can also use the specification file to create your own source RPM
package.

The sample specification file is for a complete set of Ice RPMs. In
order to properly build all of these packages, you need the full set
of system requirements for all of the packages. See each Ice
distribution for specific package and version requirements for this
version of Ice. In general you need:

 * bzip2
 * openssl
 * expat
 * Berkeley DB
 * Berkeley DB Java
 * Mono
 * Python
 * Java Development Kit

In order to build the RPMs, you need to download each source
distribution and copy or move them to your system's RPM sources
directory. For example, /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES.

This RPM specification file was tested with RPM version 4.3.2.
