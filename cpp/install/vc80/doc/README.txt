The Internet Communications Engine
----------------------------------

Ice is a modern alternative to object middleware such as CORBA or
COM/DCOM/COM+. It is easy to learn, yet provides a powerful network
infrastructure for demanding technical applications. It features an
object-oriented specification language, easy to use C++, Java, Python,
PHP, C#, and Visual Basic mappings, a highly efficient protocol,
asynchronous method invocation and dispatch, dynamic transport
plug-ins, TCP/IP and UDP/IP support, SSL-based security, a firewall
solution, and much more.

Ice is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL) (see LICENSE file). Commercial licenses are available for
customers who wish to use Ice in proprietary products. Please contact
sales@zeroc.com for more information on licensing Ice.

This file describes how to setup Visual Studio for Ice, and provides
instructions for building and running the sample programs.

See doc/README.html for information on the documentation included with
this distribution.


Binary compatibility
--------------------

Patch releases of Ice are binary compatible. For example, version 2.1.1
is compatible with 2.1.0, so you can run applications compiled with
2.1.0 with the 2.1.1 runtime without having to recompile.

With the binary installers, simply uninstall the previous version of
Ice and install the new one. Already deployed applications that were
compiled against the 2.1.0 runtime will automatically use the 2.1.1
runtime.

Note: Under Mono, binary compatibility currently does not work due to
      issues with Mono. Until this problem in Mono is fixed, you cannot
      run 2.1.0 applications against the 2.1.1 runtime.


Setting up Visual Studio 2005
-----------------------------

Before you can use Ice in your C++ applications, you first need to
configure Visual Studio with the locations of the Ice header files,
libraries, and executables.

- In the IDE, choose Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++ Directories

- Select "Include files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\include

- Select "Library files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\lib

- Select "Executable files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\bin


Using the IceGrid Administrative Console
----------------------------------------

A Java-based graphical tool for administering IceGrid applications
is included in this distribution. The Java archive (JAR) file is
installed as

<Ice installation root directory>\bin\IceGridGUI.jar

With a suitable Java installation, you can execute the application
directly by double-clicking on its icon, or you can start it from
a command prompt:

> java -jar IceGridGUI.jar


Building and running the C++ demos
----------------------------------

The C++ demos are in the demo directory.

To build a C++ demo, start Visual Studio 2005 and open the solution
demo\demo.sln. Right click on the desired demo in the Solution Explorer
window and select "Build".

To run these demos, you need to add the Ice bin directory to your
PATH, as shown below:

set ICE_HOME=<Ice installation root directory>
set PATH=%ICE_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

Next, open a Command Prompt, change to the desired demo subdirectory,
and type 'server' to start the server. In a separate Command Prompt
window, type 'client' to start the client.

Some demo directories contain README files if additional requirements
are necessary.

Note that the IceBox demo has special requirements if you compiled
the demos in the Debug configuration. In this case, you will need to
use the debug version of the IceBox executable, which is located
in bin\iceboxd.exe.


Building and running the Java demos
-----------------------------------

The Java demos are in the demoj directory.

To build the Java demos, you need the Java SDK 1.4.2 or later, and Ant
1.6.3 or later. They can be downloaded from:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/index.jsp
http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

The ant bin directory must be added to your PATH, and the following
environment variables need to be defined:

set JAVA_HOME=<Java SDK installation root directory>
set ICE_HOME=<Ice installation root directory>
set PATH=%ICE_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

You can build all of the demos by running 'ant' in the demoj
directory, or you can build individual demos by changing to the
desired subdirectory and then running 'ant'.

Before running the demos you must modify your CLASSPATH as follows:

set CLASSPATH=%ICE_HOME%\lib\Ice.jar;%ICE_HOME%\lib\db.jar;classes;%CLASSPATH%

In addition, the JVM requires the directory containing the Berkeley DB
libraries to be listed in java.library.path, therefore the Ice bin
directory must be in your PATH in order to use the Java demos that
depend on the Freeze component of Ice.

To run a demo, open a Command Prompt, change to the desired demo
directory, and enter the following command to run the server:

java Server

In a separate Command Prompt window, enter the following command to
run the client:

java Client

Some demo directories contain README files if additional requirements
are necessary.

Running the Python demos
------------------------

The Python demos are in the demopy directory.

You need Python 2.4.2 to run the demos. A binary installer for Python
can be downloaded from:

http://www.python.org/download

You also need to add the Ice bin directory to your PATH, for example:

set ICE_HOME=<Ice installation root directory>
set PATH=%ICE_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

Finally, set PYTHONPATH so that the Python interpreter is able to load
the Ice extension:

set PYTHONPATH=%ICE_HOME%\python

To run a demo, open a Command Prompt, change to the desired demo
directory, and type 'python Server.py' to start the server. In a
separate Command Prompt window, type 'python Client.py' to run the
client.
