The Internet Communications Engine
----------------------------------

Ice is a modern alternative to object middleware such as CORBA or
COM/DCOM/COM+. It is easy to learn, yet provides a powerful network
infrastructure for demanding technical applications. It features an
object-oriented specification language, easy to use C++, Java, Python,
PHP, C#, and Visual Basic mappings, a highly efficient protocol,
asynchronous method invocation and dispatch, dynamic transport
plug-ins, TCP/IP and UDP/IP support, SSL-based security, a firewall
solution, and much more.

Ice is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL) (see LICENSE file). Commercial licenses are available for
customers who wish to use Ice in proprietary products. Please contact
sales@zeroc.com for more information on licensing Ice.

This file describes how to setup Visual Studio for Ice, and provides
instructions for building and running the sample programs.

See doc/README.html for information on the documentation included with
this distribution.


Visual Studio Requirements
--------------------------

This release requires Visual Studio 2005 version 8.0.50727.42 or
later. For C# or Visual Basic, this release also requires the .NET
Framework Version 2.0.50727 or later.


Setting up Visual Studio 2005
-----------------------------

Before you can use Ice in your C++ applications, you first need to
configure Visual Studio with the locations of the Ice header files,
libraries, and executables.

- In the IDE, choose Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++ Directories

- Select "Include files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\include

- Select "Library files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\lib

- Select "Executable files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\bin


Visual C++ 2005 Express Notes
-----------------------------

Visual C++ 2005 Express is available for download from:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/

In addition to the steps listed above for setting up Visual Studio
2005, users of Visual C++ 2005 Express must also follow the
instructions at the link below for installing and configuring the
Platform SDK:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/


Using the IceGrid Administrative Console
----------------------------------------

A Java-based graphical tool for administering IceGrid applications
is included in this distribution. The Java archive (JAR) file is
installed as

<Ice installation root directory>\bin\IceGridGUI.jar

With a suitable Java installation, you can execute the application
directly by double-clicking on its icon, or you can start it from
a command prompt:

> java -jar IceGridGUI.jar


Building and running the C++ demos
----------------------------------

The C++ demos are in the demo directory.

To build a C++ demo, start Visual Studio 2005 and open the solution
demo\demo.sln. Right click on the desired demo in the Solution Explorer
window and select "Build".

To run these demos, you need to add the Ice bin directory to your
PATH, as shown below:

set ICE_HOME=<Ice installation root directory>
set PATH=%ICE_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

Next, open a Command Prompt, change to the desired demo subdirectory,
and type 'server' to start the server. In a separate Command Prompt
window, type 'client' to start the client.

Some demo directories contain README files if additional requirements
are necessary.


Building and running the C# demos
---------------------------------

The C# demos are in the democs directory.

To build a C# demo, start Visual Studio 2005 and open the solution
democs\demo.sln. Right click on the desired demo in the Solution
Explorer window and select "Build".

To run a demo, open a Command Prompt, change to the desired demo
directory, and type 'server.exe' to start the server. In a separate
Command Prompt window, type 'client.exe' to run the client.

Some demo directories contain README files if additional requirements
are necessary.


Building and running the Visual Basic demos
-------------------------------------------

The Visual Basic demos are in the demovb directory.

If you are using Visual Basic 2005 Express, you must execute a
command-line tool before building any of the demos. Change to the
demovb directory and run this command:

..\bin\generatevb . build

To build a Visual Basic demo, start Visual Studio 2005 and open the
solution demovb\demo.sln. Right click on the desired demo in the
Solution Explorer window and select "Build".

To run a demo, open a Command Prompt, change to the desired demo
directory, and type 'server.exe' to start the server. In a separate
Command Prompt window, type 'client.exe' to run the client.

Some demo directories contain README files if additional requirements
are necessary.


Building and running the Java demos
-----------------------------------

The Java demos are in the demoj directory.

To build the Java demos, you need the Java SDK 1.4.2 or later, and Ant
1.6.3 or later. They can be downloaded from:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/index.jsp
http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

The ant bin directory must be added to your PATH, and the following
environment variables need to be defined:

set JAVA_HOME=<Java SDK installation root directory>
set ICE_HOME=<Ice installation root directory>
set PATH=%ICE_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

You can build all of the demos by running 'ant' in the demoj
directory, or you can build individual demos by changing to the
desired subdirectory and then running 'ant'.

Before running the demos you must modify your CLASSPATH as follows:

set CLASSPATH=%ICE_HOME%\lib\Ice.jar;%ICE_HOME%\lib\db.jar;classes;%CLASSPATH%

If you prefer to use Ice for Java5 instead, modify your CLASSPATH
as shown below:

set CLASSPATH=%ICE_HOME%\lib\java5\Ice.jar;%ICE_HOME%\lib\db.jar;classes;%CLASSPATH%

In addition, the JVM requires the directory containing the Berkeley DB
libraries to be listed in java.library.path, therefore the Ice bin
directory must be in your PATH in order to use the Java demos that
depend on the Freeze component of Ice.

To run a demo, open a Command Prompt, change to the desired demo
directory, and enter the following command to run the server:

java Server

In a separate Command Prompt window, enter the following command to
run the client:

java Client

Some demo directories contain README files if additional requirements
are necessary.


Running the Python demos
------------------------

The Python demos are in the demopy directory.

You need Python 2.4.3 to run the demos. A binary installer for Python
can be downloaded from:

http://www.python.org/download

You also need to add the Ice bin directory to your PATH, for example:

set ICE_HOME=<Ice installation root directory>
set PATH=%ICE_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

Finally, set PYTHONPATH so that the Python interpreter is able to load
the Ice extension:

set PYTHONPATH=%ICE_HOME%\python

To run a demo, open a Command Prompt, change to the desired demo
directory, and type 'python Server.py' to start the server. In a
separate Command Prompt window, type 'python Client.py' to run the
client.


Binary compatibility
--------------------

Patch releases of Ice are binary compatible. For example, version <x>.<y>.1
is compatible with <x>.<y>.0, so you can run applications compiled with
<x>.<y>.0 with <x>.<y>.1 (or later) assemblies without having to recompile.

With the binary installers, simply uninstall the previous version of
Ice and install the new one. Already deployed applications that were
compiled against the <x>.<y>.<z> run time will automatically use the
<x>.<y>.<z or z+n> assemblies.

Note: Under Mono, binary compatibility currently does not work due to
      issues with Mono. Until this problem in Mono is fixed, you cannot
      run applications compiled with previous minor versions of Ice
      against a newer version of the Ice assemblies. For example, an
      application compiled with version <x>.<y>.0 of Ice cannot run with
      the <x>.<y>.1 Ice assemblies.
