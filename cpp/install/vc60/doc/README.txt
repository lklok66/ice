The Internet Communications Engine
----------------------------------

Ice is a modern alternative to object middleware such as CORBA or
COM/DCOM/COM+. It is easy to learn, yet provides a powerful network
infrastructure for demanding technical applications. It features an
object-oriented specification language, easy to use C++, Java, Python,
PHP, C#, and Visual Basic mappings, a highly efficient protocol,
asynchronous method invocation and dispatch, dynamic transport
plug-ins, TCP/IP and UDP/IP support, SSL-based security, a firewall
solution, and much more.

Ice is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL) (see LICENSE file). Commercial licenses are available for
customers who wish to use Ice in proprietary products. Please contact
sales@zeroc.com for more information on licensing Ice.

This file describes how to setup Visual Studio 6.0 for Ice, and
provides instructions for building and running the sample programs.

See doc/README.html for information on the documentation included with
this distribution.


Binary compatibility
--------------------

Patch releases of Ice are binary compatible. For example, version 3.0.1
is compatible with 3.0.0, so you can run applications compiled with
3.0.0 with the 3.0.1 runtime without having to recompile.

With the binary installers, simply uninstall the previous version of
Ice and install the new one. Already deployed applications that were
compiled against the 3.0.0 runtime will automatically use the 3.0.1
runtime.

Note: Under Mono, binary compatibility currently does not work due to
      issues with Mono. Until this problem in Mono is fixed, you cannot
      run 3.0.0 applications against the 3.0.1 runtime.


Visual Studio Requirements
--------------------------

Ice requires Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 5 or later. We recommend
using the most recent update, Service Pack 6.


Setting up Visual Studio 6.0
----------------------------

Before you can use Ice in your C++ applications, you first need to
configure Visual Studio with the locations of the Ice header files,
libraries, and executables.

- In the IDE, choose Tools->Options->Directories

- Select "Include files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\include and <Ice installation
  root directory>\include\stlport

  Move the stlport include directory to the top of the list, or at
  least before the Visual C++ include directories. This is necessary
  so that the compiler uses the STL headers from the STLport library
  instead of the Visual C++ STL library.

- Select "Library files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\lib

- Select "Executable files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\bin


Building and running the C++ demos
----------------------------------

The C++ demos are in the demo directory.

To build the C++ demos, start Visual Studio and open the workspace
demo\demo.dsw. Set your active project to "all" using Project->Set
Active Project, then start the compilation using Build->Build.

To run these demos, you need to add the Ice bin directory to your
PATH, as shown below:

set ICE_HOME=<Ice installation root directory>
set PATH=%ICE_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

Next, open a Command Prompt, change to the desired demo subdirectory,
and type 'server' to start the server. In a separate Command Prompt
window, type 'client' to start the client.

Some demo directories contain README files if additional requirements
are necessary.
