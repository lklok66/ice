Building the Demos - Unix
=========================

These instructions assume that you have correctly configured your
environment according to the directions in the README or platform-
specific INSTALL file included with your Ice installation.

You can build the demos by visiting each demo directory (e.g., demo,
demoj, democs) and running 'gmake' or 'ant' as appropriate. The Ice
for Python and Ice for PHP demos do not need to be compiled.

gmake 3.80 is required to build the C++ and C# demos. The 'ant'
utility is required to build the Java demos, and can be downloaded
from

http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

Ice requires ant 1.6.3 or later, but we recommend using the most
recent release.


Building the Demos - Borland C++Builder
=======================================

These instuctions are for building the C++ demos using Borland
C++Builder 2006. First you must set up your couple of environment
variables to indicate the location of your Ice installation.

$ set ICE_HOME=<Ice installation root directory>
$ set PATH=%ICE_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

Then go to the demo directory and run

$ nmake /f Makefile.mak

nmake is required to build the demos. If not already installed it can be 
downloaded at the following link:

Running the Ice Demos
=====================

Most demos consist of a single server and client. The instructions to
run a demo depend on the programming language. Instructions for each
language are included below.  Some demo directories contain README
files if additional steps are necessary.


Running the C++ demos
=====================

To run a demo, open a terminal terminal window, change to the desired
demo directory, and enter the following command to run the server:

$ ./server

To run the client, open another terminal window, also change to the
desired demo directory, and run:

$ ./client


Running the Java demos
======================

To run the demos you need to add classes to your CLASSPATH.

export CLASSPATH=classes:$CLASSPATH

To run a demo, open a terminal window, change to the desired demo
directory, and enter the following command to run the server:

$ java Server

To run the client, open another terminal window, also change to the
desired demo directory, and run:

$ java Client


Running the C# demos
====================

The C# demos are only officially supported under Linux or Windows,
therefore the Ice for C# runtime is only included in the Linux and
Windows distributions.

To run a demo, open a terminal window, change to the desired demo
directory, and enter the following command to run the server:

$ ./server.exe

To run the client, open another terminal window, also change to the
desired demo directory, and run:

$ ./client.exe


Running the Python demos
========================

To run a demo, open a terminal window, change to the desired demo
directory, and enter the following command to run the server:

$ python Server.py

To run the client, open another terminal window, also change to the
desired demo directory, and run:

$ python Client.py


Running the PHP demos
=====================

Two PHP demos are provided in the demophp directory.

You'll need PHP 5.1.4 to use the demos. Source and binary
distributions of PHP can be obtained from

http://www.php.net/downloads.php

The Ice extension for PHP is provided as a dynamically-loadable shared
library (lib/icephp.so) in the Linux and MacOS X binary
distributions. On all other Unix platforms, the Ice extension can only
be used in a static configuration, which requires that you build PHP
and the Ice extension from source code. Please refer to the INSTALL
file included in the IcePHP source distribution for more information.

The example in demophp/Ice/hello demonstrates the use of the Ice
extension for PHP in a dynamic Web page, whereas the example in
demophp/Ice/value requires PHP's command line interpreter. Both
examples require that an Ice server be available; a matching server
from any of the other language mappings can be used. A README file is
provided in each of the example directories.

Note that you must modify the php.ini files in each demo directory to
match your PHP installation and ensure that the Ice extension is
loaded properly.
