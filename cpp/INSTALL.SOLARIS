======================================================================
Requirements
======================================================================


Operating System
----------------

Ice is expected to build and run properly on Solaris 8, Solaris 9
and Solaris 10 on SPARC and x86/x64. However, Ice is officially
supported only on Solaris 10 update 5 or greater for both SPARC and
x86/x64.

You also need to have /dev/urandom installed. This is installed by
default on Solaris 9 and Solaris 10; on Solaris 8, you need to install 
patch 112438-01.


C++ compiler
------------

Ice is expected to build properly with GCC 3.4 or later. However, only
the following compilers are officially supported:

- GCC 3.4.3 on x86/x64
- GCC 4.3.2 on SPARC


Third-party libraries
---------------------

Ice has dependencies on a number of third-party libraries:

- Berkeley DB 4.8.24
- expat 1.95.7 or 2.0.0
- OpenSSL 0.9.7 or later (OpenSSL 0.9.8 or later recommended)
- bzip2 1.0.x
- mcpp 2.7.2 (with patches)
- libiconv 1.13.1 (x86/x64 only)

We recommend downloading the Ice third-party source archive from

  http://www.zeroc.com/download.html

This archive contains the source distributions for each of the
third-party dependencies, as well as required source patches and 
configuration instructions.

For more information about these dependencies, please refer to
the links below:

Berkeley DB    http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/index.html
expat          http://expat.sourceforge.net
OpenSSL        http://www.openssl.org
bzip2          http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2
mcpp           http://mcpp.sourceforge.net
libiconv       http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv


GNU Make 3.80
-------------

GNU Make 3.80 is required to build Ice on Solaris. GNU make is
distributed on the "Solaris 10 OS Companion Software DVD":

http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/freeware/


======================================================================
Compilation and Testing
======================================================================

Extract the Ice archive in any directory you like (for example, in
your home directory):

$ gtar xvfz Ice-@ver@.tar.gz

Change the working directory to Ice-@ver@/cpp:

$ cd Ice-@ver@/cpp

Edit config/Make.rules to establish your build configuration. The
comments in the file provide more information. Pay particular
attention to the variables that define the locations of the third-
party libraries.

If you want to build with Sun CC instead of g++, edit the file
config/Make.rules.SunOS and change or uncomment the CXX = <compiler>
line (at the top of the file). The default value for CXX with GNU make
is g++.

Now you're ready to build Ice:

$ gmake

This will build the Ice core libraries, services, tests and examples.

Python is required to run the test suite:

  http://www.python.org/download

After a successful build, you can run the test suite:

$ gmake test

This is equivalent to:

$ python allTests.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of "ok" messages. In
case of a failure, the tests abort with "failed".

If you want to try out any of the demos, make sure to update your PATH
environment variable to add the "bin" directory, and your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to add the "lib" directory.  For
64-bit builds, add "lib" to LD_LIBRARY_PATH_64:

$ export PATH=`pwd`/bin:$PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH_64=`pwd`/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH_64


======================================================================
64-bit builds
======================================================================

To build Ice in 64-bit mode, you need to do the following:

- Obtain or build all the third-party dependencies, and put the 64-bit
  libraries in the appropriate lib subdirectory (lib/sparcv9 on SPARC,
  lib/amd64 on x86).

- Set the environment variable LP64 to yes, as shown below:

  $ export LP64=yes

- Build and test as described above.


======================================================================
Installation
======================================================================

Simply run "gmake install". This will install Ice in the directory
specified by the "prefix" variable in config/Make.rules.

After installation, make sure that the <prefix>/bin directory is in
your PATH, and the <prefix>/lib directory is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
When compiling Ice programs, you must pass the location of the
<prefix>/include directory to the compiler with the -I option, and the
location of the <prefix>/lib directory with the -L option.

If you built in 64-bit mode, the libraries are installed in
<prefix>/lib/sparcv9 or <prefix>/lib/amd64, depending on your system's
architecture. Executables are installed in <prefix>/bin/sparcv9 or
<prefix>/bin/amd64. No other changes are necessary.
