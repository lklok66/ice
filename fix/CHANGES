Changes since first release to QIM (Feb 5th, 2009)

- Added Bridge::getAdmin() to get the administrative object associated
  with the bridge.

- The IceFIX now correctly reverse routes "Reject" messages.

- Removed property IceFix.Data. To set the database location, the
  standard Freeze property "Freeze.DbEnv.<service-name>.DbHome"
  should be used.  Note that the IceGrid deployment, as demonstrated
  in demo/grid and democs/grid, automatically sets this property.

- Added new IceGrid deployment demos demo/grid, democs/grid.

- Changed the icefixserver to an IceBox service. As such the default
  identities of the default bridge & admin objects have changed to
  IceFIX/Admin, IceFIX/Bridge.

- Fixed bug where Executor::destroy would lose the client QoS.
