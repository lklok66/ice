Changes since second release to QIM (Feb 12th, 2009)

- The Bridge::connect method signature was changed to return the
  executor proxy, rather than use an out parameter.

- Changed the C# build to generate tie servants for IceFIX.

- Changed the demo clients to support more FIX messages.

- Added FIX server demo/server. This server is an order matching
  server, which supports NewOrderSingle, OrderStatusRequest,
  OrderCancelRequest, and OrderCancelReplaceRequest.

- Added new demos for nonfiltered QoS clients: demo/nonfiltered
  and democs/nonfiltered.

- Added democs/backup to show how to backup the IceFIX bridge
  database.

- Added property validation, such that unknown IceFIX properties
  generate an Ice logger warning.

- Bridge properties are now correctly prefixed with the service name.

- Added test suite.

- Executor::execute now returns the sequence number of the sent FIX
  message. This allows correlation of the FIX message to Reject or
  BusinessRejectMessage.

- Implemented Bridge::clean.

- Changed signature of Bridge::clean to return the number of records
  erased (or would be erased), and take a boolean argument which
  indicates whether the records are actually erased.

- Added the new icefixadmin commands "clean" and "testclean".

- Stopped using the FIX::ScreenLogFactory. The bridge now logs to the
  Communicator Logger. Added three properties to control the logged
  events. Each of these properties default to 0, meaning log no
  information.

    * IceFIX.Trace.Incoming: log incoming FIX messages
    * IceFIX.Trace.Outgoing: log outgoing FIX messages
    * IceFIX.Trace.Event: log FIX lifecycle events


Changes since first release to QIM (Feb 5th, 2009)

- Added Bridge::getAdmin() to get the administrative object associated
  with the bridge.

- The IceFIX bridge now correctly reverse routes "Reject" messages.

- Removed property IceFix.Data. To set the database location, the
  standard Freeze property "Freeze.DbEnv.<service-name>.DbHome" should
  be used. Note that the IceGrid deployment, as demonstrated in
  demo/grid and democs/grid, automatically sets this property.

- Added new IceGrid deployment demos demo/grid and democs/grid.

- Changed the icefixserver to an IceBox service. As such the default
  identities of the default bridge and admin objects have changed to
  IceFIX/Admin and IceFIX/Bridge, respectively.

- Fixed bug where Executor::destroy would lose the client QoS.
