=========================================================================
Requirements
=========================================================================

- Python 2.3 or 2.4
- Ice 2.1.0

If you don't have Python 2.3 or Python 2.4 on your system, you can
download a source distribution from http://www.python.org.

If you have downloaded a source distribution of Ice for Python, see
the build instructions below.

If you have downloaded a binary distribution of Ice for Python, you
have everything you need to use Ice in Python; it is not necessary to
download and build Ice for C++. See the section "Configuring your
Environment" below.


=========================================================================
Building the Ice extension for Python (Linux/Solaris/HP-UX/Mac OS X)
=========================================================================

Follow these steps to build the Ice extension for Python:

1) Edit config/Make.rules and do the following:

   * Modify the installation prefix (if necessary).

   * Review the comments describing the PYTHON_HOME variable.

2) Execute 'python -V' to verify that the correct Python interpreter
   is in your executable search path.

3) Run 'make'.

4) Upon successful completion, run 'make install'. You may need
   additional user priveleges to install in the directory specified by
   config/Make.rules.

5) See "Configuring your Environment" below.


=========================================================================
Building the Ice extension for Python (Windows)
=========================================================================

The Python interpreter is readily available on Windows platforms. You
can build it yourself using Microsoft Visual C++, or obtain a binary
distribution from the Python web site (http://www.python.org).

Follow these steps to build the Ice extension for Python:

1) Configure Visual C++ so that it can find the Ice and Python include
   files and libraries.

   If Python is installed in C:\Python24, then you need to add
   C:\Python24\include as the include directory and C:\Python24\libs
   as the library directory.

2) Open the "all.dsw" workspace. If you are using Visual C++ .NET, the
   project files will first need to be converted from the Visual C++
   6.0 format.

3) Set your active project to "IcePy". Note that the default
   configuration is a Debug build, which requires that the debug
   libraries be available for Python and Ice. (The debug library is
   not included in the binary distribution from python.org.)

   The project assumes you are building an extension for Python 2.4.
   If you are using Python 2.3, you will need to modify the project
   settings to use the Python 2.3 library.

4) Build the "IcePy" project.

5) See "Configuring your Environment" below.

NOTES:

 * When compiling the Python interpreter from sources using Microsoft
   Visual C++ 6.0, the presence of the STLport header files causes a
   compilation error. The solution is to temporarily remove or rename
   the STLport include directory in your Visual C++ settings using
   Tools/Options/Directories/Include files.


=========================================================================
Configuring your Environment
=========================================================================

Unix:

   Modify your PYTHONPATH environment variable to include the Ice for
   Python extension. Assuming you installed the extension in the
   default directory (/opt/IcePy-2.1.0), you would modify your
   environment as shown below:

   export ICEPY_HOME=/opt/IcePy-2.1.0
   export PYTHONPATH=$ICEPY_HOME/lib:$ICEPY_HOME/python:$PYTHONPATH

Windows:

   Modify your environment to allow Python to find the Ice for Python
   extension. The interpreter must be able to locate the extension DLL
   as well as the Python source files in the "python"
   subdirectory. This is normally accomplished by setting the
   PYTHONPATH environment variable to contain the necessary
   subdirectories. For example, if the Ice for Python extension is
   installed in C:\IcePy-2.1.0, you could configure your environment
   as follows:

   set ICEPY_HOME=C:\IcePy-2.1.0
   set PYTHONPATH=%ICEPY_HOME%\bin;%ICEPY_HOME%\python


=========================================================================
Running the Tests
=========================================================================

The test subdirectory contains Python implementations of the core Ice
test suite.

To run all of the tests, do the following:

$ python allTests.py

You can also run tests individually by changing to the test directory
and running this command:

$ python run.py


=========================================================================
Python Platform Notes (HP-UX)
=========================================================================

The Python sources need to be compiled with the following options in
order to successfully load the Ice extension:

./configure --enable-shared --with-cxx="aCC -AA +DAportable" --with-libs="-lxnet" ...
