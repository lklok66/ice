Demos in this directory:

- bidir

  This demo shows how to use bi-directional connections for
  callbacks. This is typically used if the server cannot open a
  connection to the client to send callbacks, for example, because
  firewalls block incoming connections to the client.

- callback

  A simple callback demo that illustrates how a client can pass a
  proxy to a server, invoke an operation in the server, and the server
  call back into an object provided by the client as part of that
  invocation.

- hello

  This demo illustrates how to invoke ordinary (twoway) operations, as
  well as how to invoke oneway operations, use datagrams, secure
  invocations, and how to used batched invocations.

- latency

  A simple latency test that measures the basic call dispatch delay of
  Ice.

- throughput

  A simple throughput demo that allows you to send sequences of
  various types between client and server and to measure the maximum
  bandwidth that can be achieved using serialized synchronous
  requests.

- value

  This demo shows how to use classes, class factories, and the
  difference between local and remote invocations of class operations.

- session

  This demo shows how to create a session manager and sessions so
  that client specific server side resources are cleaned up when the client
  shutsdown or crashes.
