Changes since version 2.1.1
---------------------------

- Fixed a bug that resulted in an UnmarshalOutOfBoundsException when
  Slice definitions are reloaded.

Changes since version 2.1.0
---------------------------

- Added sequences of fixed-length elements to throughput demo.

- Added -E option to the various Slice compilers to print preprocessor
  output on stdout.

- Fixed a bug in the option parsing for Ice tools such as slice2cpp,
  slice2java, slice2cs, etc. The option parser used to incorrectly
  complain about repeated options when in fact no option was
  repeated. Also changed the parser to permit options to follow an
  argument, so

      slice2cpp -I. x.ice

  and

      slice2cpp x.ice -I.

  are now equivalent.

Changes since version 2.0.0
---------------------------

- Added support for Mac OS X 10.3.x

- Added support for stringifying generated types.

- Added support for Ice::Connection, which is accessible to servants
  from Ice::Current, and to clients from the proxy operation
  ice_connection.

- Added setDefaultContext() and getDefaultContext() to the
  Ice::Communicator interface. This allows a default context to be
  established on a communicator-wide basis. See section 29.9.3 in
  the doc.

  Added ice_defaultContext to Ice::ObjectProxy. This creates a new
  proxy that uses the default context established on the communicator.

- Modified the checkedCast member function of the generated Prx
  classes to accept an optional trailing argument of type Ice::Context.
  This makes it possible to do stateful things that require a context
  in a servant locator's activate() method.
