Changes since version 2.1.1
---------------------------

- Fixed a bug that resulted in an UnmarshalOutOfBoundsException when
  Slice definitions are reloaded.

Changes since version 2.0.0
---------------------------

- Added support for Mac OS X 10.3.x

- Added support for stringifying generated types.

- Added support for Ice::Connection, which is accessible to servants
  from Ice::Current, and to clients from the proxy operation
  ice_connection.

- Added setDefaultContext() and getDefaultContext() to the
  Ice::Communicator interface. This allows a default context to be
  established on a communicator-wide basis. See section 29.9.3 in
  the doc.

  Added ice_defaultContext to Ice::ObjectProxy. This creates a new
  proxy that uses the default context established on the communicator.

- Modified the checkedCast member function of the generated Prx
  classes to accept an optional trailing argument of type Ice::Context.
  This makes it possible to do stateful things that require a context
  in a servant locator's activate() method.
