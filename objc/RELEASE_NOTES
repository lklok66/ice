Ice Touch Feature Set
---------------------

Ice Touch supports the following Ice features:

  - Thread pools
  - AMI
  - Objects by Value
  - Opaque endpoints
  - Router
  - Locator
  - Batch invocations
  - SSL
  - Support for callbacks hosted by bi-directional and routed object
    adapters
  - Default servants
  - Dispatch interceptors
  - UDP (on the iPhone, UDP requests do not transparently establish
    the 3G/Edge connection)
  - Dynamic Ice
  - Full server-side support
  - Active connection management


SSL Support
-----------

Ice Touch SSL provides a subset of the Ice for C++ SSL functionality.

The following limitation applies:

 - Ice Touch servers cannot authenticate SSL clients.

The supported properties are listed below. Unless otherwise noted, the
properties have the semantics documented in the Ice Manual.

 - IceSSL.DefaultDir

   See below for more information on how Ice Touch locates certificate
   files.

 - IceSSL.CheckCertName

 - IceSSL.CertAuthFile

   If a certificate authority is not specified, all certificate
   authorities in the keychain are used. For CA certificates, Ice
   Touch supports only DER encoding.

   See below for more information on how Ice Touch locates certificate
   files.

 - IceSSL.CertFile

   Ice Touch supports only PKCS#12 (.PFX) encoded certificates.

   See below for more information on how Ice Touch locates certificate
   files.

 - IceSSL.Password

 - IceSSL.TrustOnly.Client

   The property specifies an X509v3 subject key identifier. The
   property value is composed of a series of hex values separated by
   colons or spaces. For example:

   "C2:E8:D3:33:D7:83:99:6E:08:F7:C2:34:31:F7:1E:8E:44:87:38:57"

   Since this value is specific to a single certificate authority,
   this property is valid only when used in conjunction with
   IceSSL.CertAuthFile.

These properties are necessary only for the Mac OS X or iPhone
simulator target:

 - IceSSL.Keychain

  This property specifies the keychain used to import the certificate
  from IceSSL.CertFile. If not specified, the "login" keychain is used
  by default. If the specified keychain does not exist, it is created.

 - IceSSL.KeychainPassword

  The password for the above keychain.

The semantics for locating certificate files identified by the
properties IceSSL.CertAuthFile and IceSSL.CertFile depend on whether
the IceSSL.DefaultDir property is also defined. In either case, Ice
Touch looks for the file in the application's resource bundle and in
the file system.

If IceSSL.DefaultDir is defined, Ice Touch tries the following
locations:

  Resources/<DefaultDir>/<file>
  <DefaultDir>/<file>

If IceSSL.DefaultDir is not defined, Ice Touch tries the following
locations:

  Resources/<file>
  <file>


Loggers
-------

Custom loggers must be installed via ICEInitializationData. You cannot
use any of the Ice for C++ logger properties, such as Ice.UseSyslog,
and you cannot install a custom logger with a plug-in (Ice.Plugin.*).


Garbage Collection
------------------

The Ice Touch run time cannot garbage collect graphs of objects
containing cycles. For example,

class Foo
{
    Foo next;
};

Foo a = [[Foo alloc] init];
Foo b = [[Foo alloc] init];
a.next = b;
b.next = a;

If you send this graph over the wire, your application will leak
memory unless you somehow retain the graph and manually break the
cycle.

Ice Touch has not been tested with Objective-C garbage collection on
Mac OS X.


Auto release pool
-----------------

The Ice run time creates an NSAutoReleasePool object before each
server-side dispatched invocation and client-side AMI callback. The
pool is released once the dispatch is complete.


Library demo
------------

The library demos included in the distribution (demo/Database/library,
demo/iPhone/library) run against a new Java JDBC demo. ZeroC hosts
a server for this demo on demo2.zeroc.com. The demos, by default,
connect with this host.

This demo will be released in the next Ice distribution. In the
meantime, the complete source for this demo can be found at:
