# in the default "login" keychain. In order to be compatible with Ice
# 3.3.0 servers, we use the 3.3.0 certificates. Unfortunately these
# certificates have duplicate serial numbers which prevents them from
# being imported into the same keychain (the certificates from the
# objc/test/certs directory don't suffer from this issue).
