This demo illustrates how to integrate Ice with a simple graphical
application.

The demo shows how to make:

  - Twoway invocations. This is the default mode for any remote
    invocation. A twoway invocation is not complete until a reply has
    been received from the server.

  - Oneway invocations. A oneway invocation is complete as soon as the
    client has successfully sent the invocation. Oneway invocations
    may not return values, or throw user exceptions.

  - Oneway batched invocations. See below for details on batching.

  - Datagram invocations. Datagram invocations use the udp transport,
    and as such have very minimal quality of service guarantees.
    Datagram invocations are always oneway.

  - Datagram batched invocations. See below for details on batching.

Batching, which is only possible when using oneway or datagram
invocations, combines several Ice messages into a single physical
protocol message. Batching can result in higher throughput and smaller
physical messages due to less protocol overhead. Ice does not actually
send a batched message until it is flushed.

If you enable secure invocations, oneway and twoway operations are
sent using the SSL transport. It is not possible to secure datagram
invocations.

All invocations use asynchronous method invocations (AMI) to avoid
blocking the GUI thread and ensure a responsive user experience.

This demo runs against any hello server, such as the server in
objc/demo/Ice/hello. To run the server in objc/demo/Ice/hello, it must
have been previously built with the Mac OS X version of Ice Touch in a
separate build tree.

To test timeouts, you can use the timeout slider to set a timeout on
the client proxy and the delay slider to set a delayed response in the
server to cause a timeout. In the case of a timeout, you will notice
that the server prints two "Hello World!" messages. This happens
because the Slice operation sayHello is marked as idempotent, meaning
that Ice does not need to preserve the at-most-once retry semantics.
See the manual for more information about retry behavior.

Note that SSL is not avaible when running the demo in the iPhone simulator.
