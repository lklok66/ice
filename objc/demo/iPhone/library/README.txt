This demo is an iPhone client for a new library demo, with a server
implemented using Java and JDBC. This application provides a graphical
interface to a library server. It permits you to:

  - Create and delete books
  - Query for books by isbn, author or title
  - Rent and return books

ZeroC hosts a server for this demo on demo2.zeroc.com. The iPhone
client connects to this host by default. The deployment on
demo2.zeroc.com accepts both secure and non-secure connections using
Glacier2. Direct connections to the library session manager are not
permitted on demo2.zeroc.com.

This demo will be released in the next Ice distribution. Meanwhile, if
you would like to run the server yourself, or are otherwise interested
in the demo, the complete source can be downloaded at the link below:
