Changes since version 1.1.0
---------------------------

- Update Ice Touch Xcode plug-in to support Xcode 3.2, Xcode 4.0,
  and Xcode 4.1

- Updated Ice Touch to support OS X 10.7 (Lion) and Xcode 4.1

- Updated build system to create fat binaries with armv6 and armv7
  architectures when building the iPhoneOS SDK

Changes since version 1.0.0
---------------------------

- Added ability to define default values for Slice data members. For
  example, you can write:

  // Slice
  class C
  {
      int i = 2;
      string name = "John";
  };

- Updated Ice Touch to support iOS 4.

- Fixed bug that could cause GC resurrection errors.

- Added support for accessory transport. This transport is built on
  top of the iPhone OS External Accessory framework and allows Ice
  clients to talk to iPhone accessories over Bluetooth or USB. For
  information on the Ice server-side running on iPhone accessories,
  please contact us at info@zero.com.

- Replaced the AMI mapping. Applications that use the AMI mapping from
  Ice Touch 1.0 must be updated. Refer to the Ice manual for more
  information on the new mapping.

- SSL now works with the iOS simulator.

- The iOS simulator builds now use static linking.

- The Xcode plug-in now adds -all_load to the linker flags. See
  http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/qa/qa2006/qa1490.html for
  more information.

- The demos and tests were updated to support the iPad screen
  resolution.

- Ice threads are now registered with the garbage collector.

- The ICECallbackOnMainThread helper has been removed. The new Ice
  dispatcher facility should be used instead.

- Unmarshaling now supports size checks to prevent memory over
  allocations by malicious clients or servers.

- The Xcode plug-in now supports both 32- and 64-bit architectures.


Changes since version 0.1.0
---------------------------

- Fixed several memory leaks.

- SSL support is no longer available with the iPhone simulator.

- Set NSException.reason string for Ice local exceptions.

- Fixed several bugs and updated the name mangling for slice2objc.

- Added support for multi-architecture builds in the same source tree.
  IceTouch now supports four different build types:

  - Mac OS X command line
  - Mac OS X SDK (for Cocoa apps)
  - iPhone OS SDK
  - iPhone Simulator SDK

- The Mac build now uses the native Ice socket and ssl transports.
  This means that Mac/Cocoa applications use the same SSL properties
  as other Ice for C++ applications.

- The iPhone library demo can now securely connect to both
  demo2.zeroc.com and a locally hosted demo.

- Added username/password field to the iPhone library demo.

- Fixed a bug in the iPhone chat demo where entering only white
  space in the input field would cause an exception to be thrown.

- Fixed a bug in the iPhone library & chat demos where the
  Glacier2::RouterPrx::destroySession was not called, so the
  Glacier2 session was not destroyed.

- Added "library" and "chat" demos for Cocoa.

- Added iPhone router demo.

- Added simple router client demo/Ice/helloRouter.

- Added support for GC under Mac OS.

- Changed the outParams parameter of ICEBlobject ice_invoke to
  NSMutableData**.

  was not returned.

  dispatched in the main thread.
