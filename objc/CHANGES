Changes since version 1.0.0
---------------------------

- Converted demo/iPhone/hello and test/iPhone/container to run
  on the iPad.

- Added -all_load to the linker flags in the Xcode plugin. See
  http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/qa/qa2006/qa1490.html for
  details on why this is necessary.

- Updated IceTouch to support iOS 4.

- iPhone simulator builds now use static libraries.

- Added support for accessory transport. This transport is built on
  top of the iPhone OS External Accessory framework and allows Ice
  clients to talk to iPhone accessories over Bluetooth or USB. For
  information on the Ice server side running on iPhone accessories,
  please contact us at info@zero.com.
