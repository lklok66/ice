CHANGES for Slice2Java Eclipse Plug-in 3.3.1
======================================================================

This file describes the change history for the Slice2Java Eclipse
plug-in.


======================================================================
Changes since version 0.1.1
======================================================================

- Changed version numbering scheme to reflect the minimum required Ice
  version, therefore the version for this release is 3.3.1.

- Fixed the plug-in so that Ice.jar is automatically added to the
  class path when executing an application.

- Fixed the path names of default Ice installation directories.


======================================================================
Changes since version 0.1.0
======================================================================

- Improved the Slice-to-Java translation process through tighter
  integration with the compiler. The main benefit is that errors in
  Slice files are now reported more accurately.

- Fixed the plug-in to give its builder higher precedence than the
  Java builder. This corrects several issues, such as Eclipse not
  recompiling the generated code immediately after a change to a Slice
  file, and errors resulting from Eclipse compiling application code
  before Slice translation has occurred.
