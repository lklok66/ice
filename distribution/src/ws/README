Ice is a modern object-oriented toolkit that enables you to build
distributed applications with minimal effort. Ice allows you to focus
your efforts on your application logic while it takes care of all
interactions with low-level network programming interfaces. With Ice,
there is no need to worry about details such as opening network
connections, serializing and deserializing data for network
transmission, or retrying failed connection attempts (to name but a
few of dozens of such low-level details).

In addition to fully-featured and high-performance RPC, Ice also
provides a number of services. These services supply functionality
that most distributed applications require, such as event distribution
or server management.

Ice is available under the terms and conditions of the GNU General
Public License v2 (see the ICE_LICENSE file). Commercial licenses are
available for customers who wish to use Ice in proprietary products.

Ice WebSocket transport
-----------------------

This distribution includes patched Ice and IceSSL libraries as well as
the Ice WebSocket transport. 

This transport is intended to be used in environments where only
connections to the HTTP or HTTPs ports are allowed. 

It can also be used to simplify the firewall setup on the server side
by only allowing traffic to the HTTP or HTTPs ports. A reversed HTTP
proxy can be used to forward either the HTTP traffic or web socket
traffic to the appropriate back-end servers.
