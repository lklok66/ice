 This copy of Ice is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 as

 Ice is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
 WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS

 You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License version
 2 along with this program; if not, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses.

 Linking Ice statically or dynamically with other software (such as a 
 library, module or application) is making a combined work based on Ice. 
 Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License version
 2 cover this combined work.

 If such software can only be used together with Ice, then not only the 
 combined work but the software itself is a work derived from Ice and as
 such shall be licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License 
 version 2. This includes the situation where Ice is only being used 
 through an abstraction layer.

 As a special exception to the above, ZeroC grants to the contributors for
 the following projects the permission to license their Ice-based software 
 under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 
 2.1 or of the BSD license:

  - Orca Robotics (http://orca-robotics.sourceforge.net)
 
  - Mumble (http://mumble.sourceforge.net)

 This exception does not extend to the parts of Ice used by these 
 projects, or to any other derived work: as a whole, any work based on Ice
 shall be licensed under the terms and conditions of the GNU General
 Public License version 2.

 You may also combine Ice with any software not derived from Ice, provided
 the license of such software is compatible with the GNU General Public 
 License version 2. In addition, as a special exception, ZeroC grants you
 permission to combine Ice with:
 
  - the OpenSSL library, or with a modified version of the OpenSSL library
    that uses the same license as OpenSSL

  - any library not derived from Ice and licensed under the terms of
    the Apache License, version 2.0 
    (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) 

 If you modify this copy of Ice, you may extend any of the exceptions 
 provided above to your version of Ice, but you are not obligated to 
 do so.
