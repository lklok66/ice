Introduction
======================================================================

This archive contains the source code distributions, including any
source patches, for the third-party packages required to build
Ice Touch.

This document provides instructions for applying patches and for
configuring the third-party packages.

For more information about the third-party dependencies, please refer
to the links below:

Patches
======================================================================


mcpp
----

The file mcpp/patch.mcpp.2.7.2 in this archive contains several
important fixes required by Ice Touch. We expect that these changes 
will be included in a future release of mcpp.

After extracting the mcpp source distribution, change to the top-level
directory and apply the patch as shown below:

  $ cd mcpp-2.7.2
  $ patch -p0 < patch.mcpp.2.7.2

Follow the platform-specific instructions below for configuring and
building mcpp

Build Instructions
======================================================================

mcpp
----

Ice Touch requires the library version of mcpp, so configure mcpp as
shown below:

  $ export CFLAGS="-O3 -fno-common"
  $ ./configure --enable-mcpplib --disable-shared
  (and --prefix=<dir> if you like)

For builds with support for both i386 and x86_64 architectures, use:

  $ export CFLAGS="-O3 -fno-common -arch i386 -arch x86_64"
  $ ./configure --enable-mcpplib --disable-shared
  (and --prefix=<dir> if you like)
