The Internet Communications Engine (Ice) is a modern object-oriented toolkit that enables you to build distributed applications with minimal effort. 

Ice allows you to focus your efforts on your application logic, and it takes care of all interactions with low-level network programming interfaces. With Ice, there is no need to worry about details such as opening network connections, serializing and deserializing data for network transmission, or retrying failed connection attempts (to name but a few of dozens of such low-level details).


Ice is available under the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License v2. Commercial licenses are available for customers who wish to use Ice in proprietary products.  Please contact sales@zeroc.com for more information on licensing Ice.
