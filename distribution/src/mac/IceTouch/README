Requirements
======================================================================


Operating system
----------------

Ice Touch requires:

- Mac OS X 10.6.8 or later
- iOS 4.2 or iOS 4.3.


Compiler
--------

To build iPhone applications, you need:

- Xcode 4.2 with iOS 5.0 SDK


To build Cocoa applications, you need:

- Xcode 4.2


======================================================================
Compiling the Demos
======================================================================

All the demos can be found under /Developer/Examples/IceTouch-1.2.0

To build the command-line demos:

$ cd /Developer/Examples/IceTouch-1.2.0
$ make

If you are building for Cocoa, you can use Xcode to build the demos
located in the following subdirectories of
/Developer/Examples/IceTouch-1.2.0/Cocoa

 - chat		  (Objetive-c)
 - library 	  (Objetive-c)

If you are building for iPhone or the iPhone simulator, you can
use Xcode to build the demos located in subdirectories of
/Developer/Examples/IceTouch-1.2.0/iPhone

  - chat	  (Objetive-c)
  - cpp/hello (C++)
  - library   (Objetive-c)
  - hello     (Objetive-c)
  - router    (Objetive-c)
  - voip      (Objetive-c)

======================================================================
Configuring the Xcode plug-in
======================================================================

The Xcode plug-in simplifies the process of building Ice and Ice Touch
applications and provides the following features:

  - Handles all aspects of translating your Slice files for both
    Objective-C and C++ projects
  - Incrementally recompiles Slice files after modifications
  - Maintains dependencies between Slice files
  - Highlights compilation errors in your source code

The Xcode plug-in is configured using the per-target info build
settings, just as you would configure the compiler settings. Select a
target, and enter "Slice" in the "Search in Build Settings" field.

The following fields are defined:

- Header Directory

  Directory to use as the header include directory in source files.

- Header Search Path

   Set the list of directories to search for included Slice files
   (-I option). Note that the Ice Slice files are automatically in the
   header search path.

- Ice Home

  If you are building with the Ice Touch Xcode SDK, this should be
  left unset; otherwise, if using the command-line toolkit or regular
  Ice, set this to the location of the installation (such as
  /opt/Ice-3.4.2 or /opt/IceTouch-1.2.0).

- Output Directory

  Directory to place generated source files.

- Permit `Ice' prefix

  Pass --ice to the Slice compiler.

- Streaming support

  Pass --stream to the Slice compiler (C++ only).

- Checksum support

  Pass --checksum to the Slice compiler (C++ only).

- Preprocessor Macros

  Set the list of preprocessor macros to define (-D option).

- Translate C++ code

  If set, slice2cpp will be used to translate the Slice files,
  otherwise slice2objc is used.

  When using Objective-c IceTouch SDK slice2objc is always
  used, when using C++ IceTouch SDK slice2cpp is always used.

- Underscore support

  Permit underscores in Slice identifiers.


You may set specific Slice compiler flags on individual source Slice
files, to do that select your project in the Project Navigator, select
the relevant target (you may have only one), then select the "Build Phases"
tab, expand the "Compile Sources" phase and the "Compiler Flags" column lets
you set each fileâ€™s flags for that target.
