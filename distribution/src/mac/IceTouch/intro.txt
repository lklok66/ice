Ice Touch is ZeroC's implementation of Ice for iOS devices, with full
support for the Objective-C programming language.

With Ice Touch, you can easily build distributed applications, with
apps running on iOS that communicate with server-side Ice components 
running on Mac OS X, Windows, Linux or Solaris. You can implement 
these server-side components in Objective-C (with Ice Touch on Mac 
OS X) or, using Ice, in C++, Java, C# or Python.

Ice Touch provides development kits and run times for iOS devices,
the iOS simulator and Mac OS X.

Like Ice, Ice Touch is available under the terms and conditions of 
the GNU General Public License v2. Commercial licenses are available
for customers who wish to use Ice Touch in proprietary products.  
Please contact sales@zeroc.com for more information on licensing 
Ice Touch.
