%description
mcpp is a C/C++ preprocessor with the following features.

    * Implements all of C90, C99 and C++98 specifications.
    * Provides a validation suite to test C/C++ preprocessor's conformance 
      and quality comprehensively. When this validation suite is applied,
       mcpp distinguishes itself among many existing preprocessors.
    * Has plentiful and accurate diagnostics to check all the preprocessing 
      problems such as latent bug or lack of portability in source code.
    * Has #pragma directives to output debugging information.
    * Is portable and has been ported to many compliler-systems, including 
      GCC and Visual C++, on UNIX-like systems and Windows.
    * Preprocessors of various behavior modes are able to be generated from 
      the source code.
    * Can be built either as a compiler-specific preprocessor to replace the
      resident preprocessor of a particular compiler system, or as a 
      compiler-independent command, or even as a subroutine called from some 
      other main program.
    * Provides comprehensive documents both in Japanese and in English.
    * Is an open source software released under BSD-style-license. 

It is probably number one C/C++ preprocessor now available in the world.
