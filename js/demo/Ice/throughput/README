A simple throughput demo that allows you to send sequences of various
types between client and server and to measure the maximum bandwidth
that can be achieved using serialized synchronous requests.

To run the demo, first you need to start the Ice throughput server,
you can use the Python or C++ server, follow the instructions from
the demo README to start it:

 * To use the Python server you need a python installation compatible
   with Ice for Python module included in Ice 3.5.1
   
 * To use the C++ server you need a C++ compiler compatible with Ice
   3.5.1 C++ distribution..

In a separate window, start the client:

$ node Client.js

The performance for byte sequences is expected to be greater than
for other types because the cost of marshaling and unmarshaling is
lower than for more complex types.
