A simple throughput demo that allows you to send sequences of various
types between client and server and to measure the maximum bandwidth
that can be achieved using serialized synchronous requests.

To run the demo, first follow the instructions from the C++ Ice 
throughput demo README to start the server.

In a separate window, start the client:

$ node Client.js

The performance for byte sequences is expected to be greater than
for other types because the cost of marshaling and unmarshaling is
lower than for more complex types.
