This demo is a minimal Ice "hello world" application. Each time the
client is run a "sayHello" invocation is sent to the server.

To run the demo, first follow the instructions from the C++ Ice
minimal demo README to start the server.

In a separate window, start the client:

$ node Client.js

Note that this demo hardwires port 10000. If port 10000 is not
available on your machine, you need to edit both client and server
to use a free port.
