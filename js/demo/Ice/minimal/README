This demo is a minimal Ice "hello world" application. Each time the
client is run a "sayHello" invocation is sent to the server.

To run the demo, first you need to start the Ice minimal server, you
can use the Python or C++ server, follow the instructions from the
demo README to start it:

 * To use the Python server you need a python installation compatible
   with Ice for Python module included in Ice 3.5.1
   
 * To use the C++ server you need a C++ compiler compatible with Ice
   3.5.1 C++ distribution.

In a separate window, start the client:

$ node Client.js

Note that this demo hardwires port 10000. If port 10000 is not
available on your machine, you need to edit both client and server
to use a free port.
