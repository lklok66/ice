A simple latency test that measures the basic call dispatch delay of
Ice.

To run the demo, first you need to start the Ice latency server, you
can use the Python or C++ server, follow the instructions from the
demo README to start it:

 * To use the Python server you need a python installation compatible
   with Ice for Python module included in Ice 3.5.1
   
 * To use the C++ server you need a C++ compiler compatible with Ice
   3.5.1 C++ distribution.

In a separate window, start the client:

$ node Client.js
