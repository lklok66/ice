This demo shows how to use bidirectional connections for callbacks.
This is typically used if the server cannot open a connection to the
client to send callbacks, for example, because firewalls block
incoming connections to the client.

To run the demo, first you need to start the Ice bidir server, you
can use the Python or C++ server, follow the instructions from the
demo README to start it:

 * To use the Python server you need a python installation compatible
   with Ice for Python module included in Ice 3.5.1
   
 * To use the C++ server you need a C++ compiler compatible with Ice
   3.5.1 C++ distribution.

In a separate window, start the client:

$ node Client.js
