This demo illustrates how to invoke ordinary (twoway) operations, as
well as how to make oneway and batched invocations.

To run the demo, first follow the instructions from the C++ Ice hello
demo README to start the server.

In a separate window, start the client:

$ node Client.js

To test timeouts you can use 'T' to set a timeout on the client proxy
and 'P' to set a delayed response in the server to cause a timeout.
You will notice that two "Hello World!" messages will be printed by
the server in this case. This is because the sayHello method is marked
as idempotent in the slice, meaning that Ice does not need to follow
the at-most-once retry semantics. See the manual for more information
about retry behavior.
