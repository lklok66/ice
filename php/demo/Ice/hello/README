This directory contains a PHP/HTML implementation of the Ice hello
client. The procedure for installing this script depends on your Web
server environment. For example, if you're using PHP as a Web server
module, then you'll need to install this script in your document root
directory.

Alternatively, if you're using CGI, then you will need to make this
script executable, add a line at the top of the script to indicate the
path to the PHP CGI binary, and copy the script to your cgi-bin
directory. On Linux or Solaris, the line at the top of the file should
look something like this, where /opt/php5 is the PHP5 installation
directory:

#! /opt/php5/bin/php

Next, the PHP configuration must be modified to load the Slice
definitions required by this example. In php.ini, set this directive:

ice.slice=/opt/icephp/demo/Ice/hello/Hello.ice

Finally, start the hello server on the Web server host and try out the
script.
