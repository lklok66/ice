This is a PHP version of the Ice "value" demo client.

First, review the comments in the php.ini file to determine whether
any changes are needed for your environment.

Next, start the value demo server, using any of the supported language
mappings, on this host. Finally, run the PHP client with the following
command:

$ php -c php.ini -f Client.php

Note that this client requires user input, therefore you must run this
example using the CLI version of the PHP interpreter.
