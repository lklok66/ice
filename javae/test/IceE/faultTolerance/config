# The MIDlet version of the Ice-E tests use this configuration file to
# configure proxies and endpoints. Modify the properties listed below as
# appropriate for the network configuration for your test.
#
# The server portion of this test is currently not implemented as MIDlets.

# The client MIDlet generates a list of proxies using a target hostname
# (Test.Host), a 'starting port' (Test.FirstPort), and the number of
# faultTolerance test servers to be tested against (Test.ServerCount). The test
# servers must all be running on the same host and must be running on ports in
# the range Test.FirstPort to Test.FirstPort + Test.ServerCount.

#
# Set Test.Host to the hostname or IP address for the server host.
#
Test.Host=127.0.0.1
Test.FirstPort=12340
Test.ServerCount= 12

Ice.ServerIdleTime = 120
