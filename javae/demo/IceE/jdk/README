Demos in this directory:

- bidir

  This demo shows how to use bi-directional connections for callbacks.
  This is typically used when the server cannot open a connection to
  the client to send callbacks, for example, because firewalls block
  incoming connections to the client.

- callback

  A simple callback demo that illustrates how a client can pass a
  proxy to a server, invoke an operation in the server, and the server
  call back into an object provided by the client as part of that
  invocation.

- chat

  Command-line client that works with the Glacier2 chat demo found in
  the Ice distribution.

- hello

  This demo illustrates how to invoke ordinary (twoway) operations, as
  well as how to invoke oneway operations and how to use batched
  invocations.

- latency

  A simple latency test that measures basic call dispatch delay.

- throughput

  A simple throughput demo that allows you to send sequences of
  various types between client and server and to measure the maximum
  bandwidth that can be achieved using serialized synchronous
  requests.
