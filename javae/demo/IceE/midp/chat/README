This demo provides a MIDlet client that communicates with the Glacier2
chat demo provided in the full Ice distribution (in the directory
demo/Glacier2/chat). You must build the Ice demo before you can run
this client.

To run the demo, change to the Ice demo directory and start the chat
server:

$ server

In a separate window, change to the Ice demo directory and modify the
file config.glacier2 as follows: change the Glacier2.Client.Endpoints
property to use a tcp endpoint. In addition, if the client is run
outside the Glacier2 router's host, the router must also listen on a
public interface instead of the loopback interface.

For most configurations the property can be changed from:

Glacier2.Client.Endpoints=ssl -p 10005 -h 127.0.0.1

to:

Glacier2.Client.Endpoints=tcp -p 10005

Next, start the Glacier2 router:

$ glacier2router --Ice.Config=config.glacier2

Finally, start the MIDlet. To run it in the WTK emulator, do the
following:

$ emulator -Xdescriptor:ChatDemo.jad

In the login form, enter any name and password, followed by the
host and port of the Glacier2 router.
