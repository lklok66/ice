This demo provides a MIDlet client and server that implements a
simplified version of the hello world demo from the full Ice
distribution. The client and server can be used together or with a
hello client or server from a different Ice distribution.

Run the following command to start the server MIDlet in the WTK
emulator:

$ emulator -Xdescriptor:HelloServer.jad

To run the client, use the following:

$ emulator -Xdescriptor:HelloClient.jad

If you are running the client and server on different hosts, or wish
to have them communicate on IP ports other than the configured
defaults, you need to edit the config file in this directory,
modify the Hello.Proxy and Hello.Endpoints entries, and rebuild.
