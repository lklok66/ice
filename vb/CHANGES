Changes since version 2.1.1
---------------------------

- Fixed a bug in the code generator: incorrect code was generated
  if an operation used an exception from an unrelated module in
  its exception specification.

Changes since version 2.0.0
---------------------------

- Fixed bug in the code generators for C# and VB: for sequences
  of structs and sequences of Object*, incorrect code was generated
  if a ["cs:collection"] or ["vb:collection"] metadata directive
  was used.

- Added setDefaultContext() and getDefaultContext() to the
  Ice::Communicator interface. This allows a default context to be
  established on a communicator-wide basis. See section 29.8.3 in the
  doc.

  Added ice_defaultContext to Ice::ObjectProxy. This creates a new
  proxy that uses the default context established on the communicator.

- Overloaded the checkedCast member function of the generated PrxHelper
  classes to allow a trailing argument of type Ice::Context. This makes
  it possible to do stateful things that require a context in a
  servant locator's activate() method.

- Fixed a bug in slice2vb: incorrect code was generated if an interface
  was derived from a base interface in a different module if the base
  interface contained a AMD operation.
