Build instructions
------------------

The code has been built and tested with:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Version 8.0.50727.42 and .NET Framework
  Version 2.0.50727.

Unpack the archive. The sources will be contained in the IceVB-@ver@
subdirectory.

You can either build the slice2vb compiler from the Ice for C++ source
distribution, or you can download the Ice binary installer for
Windows, which contains a compiled version of slice2vb. 

Add the directory containing slice2vb to the list of "Executable
files" directories in Visual Studio:

- In the IDE, choose Tools->Options->Projects->VC++ Directories

- Select "Executable files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\bin

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable ICE_HOME to the
location of your Ice installation root directory.

Ice for Visual Basic is a language mapping on top of Ice for C# -- the
actual run-time support is provided by the Ice for C# assembly
(icecs.dll). The Ice for Visual Basic build environment expects
icecs.dll to be installed in $(solutiondir)\..\IceCS-@ver@\bin.
Alternatively, you can install icecs.dll in the Global Assembly Cache
(GAC). If you have installed the Ice binary distribution for Windows,
the icecs.dll assembly has already been installed in the GAC. If you
prefer to install the assembly in the GAC yourself, refer to the
INSTALL file included with the Ice for C# source distribution for
instructions.


Building with Visual Basic 2005
-------------------------------

Open All.sln in Visual Basic and build the solution. (Both release
and debug builds are supported.)
