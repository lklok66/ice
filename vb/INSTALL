Build instructions
------------------

The code has been built and tested with Visual Basic Version 7.1.3088
and .NET Framework 1.1 Version 1.1.4322.

Unpack the archive. The sources will be contained in the 
IceVB-@ver@ subdirectory.

You can either build the slice2vb compiler from the Ice for C++ source
distribution, or you can download the Ice binary package for Windows,
which contains a compiled version of slice2vb. 

Add the directory containing slice2vb to the list of "Executable
files" directories in Visual Studio:

- In the IDE, choose Tools->Options->Projects->VC++ Directories

- Select "Executable files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\bin

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable ICE_HOME to the
location of your Ice installation root directory.

Open All.sln in Visual Basic# and build the "All" solution (both
debug and release builds are supported). Note that Ice for Visual
Basic is just a language mapping on top of Ice for C# -- the actual
run-time support is provided by icecs.dll. The build environment
expects icecs.dll to be installed in $(solutiondir)/icecs/bin.
Alternatively, you can install icecs.dll in the GAC. (See Ice for C#
for details of how to do this.)
