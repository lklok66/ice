Note for Mono:

    For this demo to work properly using Mono on Linux, you must configure
    Linux to recognize Mono binaries. Configuration instructions are
    provided in INSTALL.MONO at the top level of the Ice for C# source
    distribution or, if you have installed the demos from the Ice demo
    package, in README.DEMOS.

    Alternatively, if you do not want to reconfigure your kernel, or
    if you want to run with Mono under Windows, edit application.xml
    and change the server element to read:

    <server name="Server" kind="cpp" exe="mono.bat" activation="on-demand">
      <option>./server.exe</option>

    Note that the server executable is "mono.bat", and that the actual
    server executable is passed as an argument to the Mono interepreter.


To run the demo, first start the IcePack service:

$ icepacknode --Ice.Config=config --warn

In a separate window:

$ icepackadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application add 'application.xml'"
$ client.exe

This will deploy the servers described in the file "application.xml"
and start the client.

Messages will be displayed in the IcePack service window.
