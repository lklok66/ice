For this demo to work properly using Mono on Linux, you must configure
Linux to recognize Mono binaries. Configuration instructions are
provided in INSTALL.MONO at the top level of the Ice for C# source
distribution or, if you have installed the demos from the Ice demo
package, in README.DEMOS.

To run the demo, first start the IcePack service:

$ icepacknode --Ice.Config=config --warn

In a separate window:

$ icepackadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application add 'application.xml'"
$ client.exe

This will deploy the servers described in the file "application.xml"
and start the client.

Messages will be displayed in the IcePack service window.
