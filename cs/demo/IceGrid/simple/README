Note for Mono:

    For this demo to work properly using Mono on Linux, you must
    configure Linux to recognize Mono binaries. Configuration
    instructions are provided in INSTALL.MONO at the top level of the
    Ice for C# source distribution or, in README at the top level of
    the Ice binary distribution (in /usr/share/doc/Ice-@ver@ if you
    have installed Ice from RPMs).

    Alternatively, if you do not want to reconfigure your kernel, or
    if you want to run with Mono under Windows, edit application.xml
    and change the server element to read:

    <server id="SimpleServer" exe="mono" activation="on-demand">
      <option>./server.exe</option>

    Note that the server executable is "mono", and that the actual
    server executable is passed as an argument to the Mono
    interpreter.

To run the demo, first start the IceGrid service:

$ icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid

In a separate window:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "application add 'application.xml'"
$ client.exe

This will deploy the application described in the file
"application.xml" and start the client.

Messages will be displayed in the IceGrid service window.

You can also use the descriptors in the following files to deploy the
application:

- application_with_template.xml: These descriptors demonstrate the use
  of templates for the server definition. Templates make it easy to
  deploy multiple instances of the same server.

- application_with_replication.xml: These descriptors demonstrate the
  use of replication to balance the load of the application over
  several servers.

If you have already deployed the application, you can update it to try
a new set of descriptors, for example:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "application update 'application_with_template.xml'"

When using the descriptors from 'application_with_template.xml' or
'application_with_replication.xml', you can easily deploy more servers
based on the `SimpleServer' template. For example, you can use the
following command to deploy a new server:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "server template instantiate Simple localhost SimpleServer index=4"
