Note for Mono:

    For this demo to work properly using Mono on Linux, you must
    configure Linux to recognize Mono binaries. Configuration
    instructions are provided in INSTALL.MONO at the top level of the
    Ice for C# source distribution or, in README at the top level of
    the Ice binary distribution (in /usr/share/doc/Ice-@ver@ if you
    have installed Ice from RPMs).

    Alternatively, if you do not want to reconfigure your kernel, or
    if you want to run with Mono under Windows, edit application.xml
    and change the server element to read:

    <server id="SessionServer" exe="mono" activation="session">
      <option>./server.exe</option>

    Note that the server executable is "mono", and that the actual
    server executable is passed as an argument to the Mono
    interpreter.

This demo demonstrates the use of the session activation mode where
the server is activated on demand once it is allocated by the client
and it is deactivated when the client releases the server.

To run the demo, first start the IceGrid service:

$ icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid

In a separate window:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "application add 'application.xml'"
$ client.exe

This will deploy the application described in the file
"application.xml" and start the client.

Messages will be displayed in the IceGrid service window.
