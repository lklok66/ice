Ice for C# currently does not support the following features of Ice
for C++:

- Protocol encryption

- Any of the built-in Ice services (Freeze and IceBox)

Protocol compression is supported. Note that, for compression to work,
libbz2 must be installed and in your %PATH% or $LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If
libbz2 cannot be found at run time, the Ice run time automatically
disables protocol compression. You can download bzip2 at
http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2.

Supported environments:

- Visual C# (Windows)

- Mono

See INSTALL.VISUAL_C# or INSTALL.MONO for installation information.

Binary compatibility:

This release (2.1.1) of Ice for C# is binary compatible with
release 2.1.0, that is, you can run applications that were compiled
against 2.1.0 with the 2.1.1 runtime. To make this work, you must
inform the .NET runtime that 2.1.1 is binary compatible with 2.1.0
as follows:

- In a command shell, change directory to src\Ice and run:

  C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322\al.exe /link:policy.2.1.icecs /out:policy.2.1.icecs.dll /keyfile:IcecsKey.snk

- Change directory to src\Glacier2 and run:

  C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322\al.exe /link:policy.2.1.glacier2cs /out:policy.2.1.glacier2cs.dll /keyfile:Glacier2csKey.snk

- Change directory to src\IcePack and run:

  C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322\al.exe /link:policy.2.1.icepackcs /out:policy.2.1.icepackcs.dll /keyfile:IcepackcsKey.snk

- Change directory to src\IcePatch2 and run:

  C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322\al.exe /link:policy.2.1.icepatch2cs /out:policy.2.1.icepatch2cs.dll /keyfile:Icepatch2csKey.snk

- Change directory to src\IceStorm and run:

  C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322\al.exe /link:policy.2.1.icestormcs /out:policy.2.1.icestormcs.dll /keyfile:IcestormcsKey.snk

- Each of these commands produces a .dll file in the directory in which you ran the command.
  For example, the first command produces policy.2.1.icecs.dll in src/Ice.

- Start up Windows Explorer and navigate to C:\WINDOWS\assembly.

- Start up a second copy of Windows Explorer and navigate to src\Ice.

- Drag and drop the policy.2.1.icecs.dll into C:\WINDOWS\assembly.

- Repeat the previous step for each of other four DLLs (for IcePatch2, IcePack, IceStorm, and Glacier2).
