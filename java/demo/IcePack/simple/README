The IcePack node starts Java server processes. Prior to starting the
node, you must set the CLASSPATH environment variable as described in
the installation instructions.

To run the demo, first start the IcePack service:

$ icepacknode --Ice.Config=config --warn

In a separate window:

$ icepackadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application add 'application.xml'"
$ java Client

This will deploy the servers described in the file "application.xml"
and start the client.

Messages will be displayed in the IcePack service window.
