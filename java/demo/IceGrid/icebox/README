This demo shows a very simple IceGrid deployment, with a single
IceBox server hosting a number of IceBox services.


Setup
-----

Start the IceGrid registry and node:

 $ icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid

Deploy the 'HelloSimpsons' application (in file application.xml) with
the IceGrid Admin graphical tool. If you prefer to use the 
command-line utility, use:

 $ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "application add application.xml"


Using the IceGrid GUI
---------------------

We suggest using the graphical IceGrid administration tool with this
demo. Follow these steps to log into the IceGrid registry and view
the application you deployed above:

  - Launch the application. Windows users can double-click on the
    file IceGridGUI.jar located in <Ice installation directory>\bin.
    Users with a Linux RPM installation can use a script to start the
    program:

    $ icegridgui

    On other platforms, start it from a command window as follows:

    $ java -jar IceGridGUI.jar

    The location of the JAR file varies by platform; for a Linux RPM
    installation, the file resides in /usr/share/java. On other
    platforms it can be found in <Ice installation directory>/lib.

  - Select Login... from the File menu.

  - Enter any username and password combination (the password is not
    validated).

  - Enter "DemoIceGrid" for the IceGrid instance name.

  - Enter "tcp -h localhost -p 4061" for the endpoints.

  - Click OK to log in.


Running the Client
------------------

$ java Client

The client simply calls 'sayHello' on the replicated 'hello' object.


Stopping and restarting IceBox services
---------------------------------------

You can use the IceGrid GUI or the command-line utility to stop and
restart IceBox services. The commands below show how to manipulate
the 'Lisa' service:

 $ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid
 >>> service stop IceBox Lisa
 >>> service start IceBox Lisa


Administration through Glacier2
-------------------------------

This demo also includes the configuration for a Glacier2 router
(DemoGlacier2), to show how you could administer IceGrid from
 "the other side" of a firewall. (In this demo, however, all the
components run on the same system.)

Follow these steps:

 - Connect to the IceGrid registry with icegridadmin or the
   IceGrid Admin graphical utility

 - Start the DemoGlacier2 server

 - Reconnect to the IceGrid registry, this time using a Glacier2
   session. For example, using the command-line utility you must
   supply a proxy for the router:

   $ icegridadmin --Ice.Default.Router="DemoGlacier2/router:tcp -h localhost -p 4063"

   In the IceGrid GUI, use the Routed tab of the Login dialog. Change
   the Glacier2 instance name to "DemoGlacier2" and the endpoints to
   "tcp -h localhost -p 4063".
   
   DemoGlacier2 is configured to use a built-in permissions verifier
   that does not validate passwords, so you can log in using any
   username/password combination.


Vista Note
----------

On Vista-derived operating systems, the IceGrid node may emit the
following warning:

  warning: Unable to lookup the performance counter name:
  Unable to connect to the specified computer or the computer is
  offline. This usually occurs when you do not have sufficient
  privileges.

This issue can be resolved by granting appropriate permissions to the
node's user account. Please refer to the Troubleshooting section of
Appendix H in the Ice manual for more information.
